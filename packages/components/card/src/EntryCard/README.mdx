Display entries with preview and other options.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { EntryCard } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { EntryCard } from '@contentful/f36-card';
```

## Examples

The two main props to show the content of your entry are `title` and `description`.
It’s also possible to pass the Entry’s content type in the `contentType` prop.
To show a badge with the status of the entry,
you can pass one of "archived", "changed", "deleted", "draft", "new", or "published" to the `status` prop.

### Basic usage

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardExample.tsx

```

### Clickable card

Like the `Card` component, it’s possible to pass a function to the `onClick` prop
and it will be called when the user clicks on the card.

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardClickableExample.tsx

```

### Card actions

To show a `...` button with a menu in the card, pass an array of `MenuItem` components

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardActionsExample.tsx

```

### Loading state

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardLoadingExample.tsx

```

### Different sizes

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardSizesExample.tsx

```

### With a drag handle

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardDragHandleExample.tsx

```

### With a thumbnail

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardThumbnailExample.tsx

```

### With a custom badge

Like the `Card` component, it’s possible to pass a custom badge using the `badge` prop if the entity has different statuses than
"archived", "changed", "deleted", "draft", "new", or "published". In this case the `status` prop will be ignored.

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardCustomBadgeExample.tsx

```

### With a custom action button

It is also possible to pass a custom component to be rendered in place of `...` action button. In that case, the `actions` prop will be ignored.

```jsx file=../../examples/EntryCard/EntryCardCustomActionButtonExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="EntryCard" />

## Content guidelines

Since this is a very opinionated component, we recommend using it only to show your entries.
Similar to how references are shown in Contentful.

## Accessibility

It inherits the accessibility features of [Card](/components/card)
