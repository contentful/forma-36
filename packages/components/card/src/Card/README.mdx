A Card is a component to group information or content of a particular subject in one place.

## Component variations

```jsx
<Card title="Title">
  <Text>This is the Card‚Äôs content</Text>
</Card>
```

## Code examples

Here you will find the most common ways of using the Card component.

### With `onClick`

It‚Äôs possible to call an action when the user clicks on the Card. To do that, you only need to pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

```jsx
function CardExample() {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Card onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        Click on this card
        <br />
        {show && (
          <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
            ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
          </span>
        )}
      </Card>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

### Selectable cards

Sometimes you will need to use the Card as an selectable element in the UI. To achieve that behaviour,
you should use a combination of the `onClick` and `selected` props. The former controlling the latter.

```jsx
function CardsExample() {
  const [taco, setTaco] = React.useState(false);
  const [pizza, setPizza] = React.useState(false);
  const [broccoli, setBroccoli] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <Heading>What is your favorite food?</Heading>
      <div>
        <Card onClick={() => setTaco(!taco)} selected={taco}>
          <span role="img" aria-label="taco">
            üåÆ
          </span>
        </Card>
        <Card onClick={() => setPizza(!pizza)} selected={pizza}>
          <span role="img" aria-label="pizza">
            üçï
          </span>
        </Card>
        <Card onClick={() => setBroccoli(!broccoli)} selected={broccoli}>
          <span role="img" aria-label="broccoli">
            ü•¶
          </span>
        </Card>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With `link` and `target`

A Card can be used with the purpose to navigate a user to an external page. To do that a user must pass a value to the `href` prop.
Optionally, the user can pass a `target` prop to control how the link should be open.

```jsx
<Card href="https://f36.contentful.com" target="_blank">
  <Text>
    Forma 36 is an open-source design system by Contentful created with the
    intent to reduce the overhead of creating UI by providing tools and guidance
    for digital teams building and extending Contentful products.
  </Text>
</Card>
```
