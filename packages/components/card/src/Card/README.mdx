## Import

```js static=true
import { Card } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Card } from '@contentful/f36-card';
```

## Examples

Here you will find the most common ways of using the Card component.

### With `onClick`

It’s possible to call an action when the user clicks on the Card. To do that, you only need to pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/OnClickCardExample.tsx

```

### Selectable cards

Sometimes you will need to use the Card as an selectable element in the UI. To achieve that behaviour,
you should use a combination of the `onClick` and `isSelected` props. The former controlling the latter.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/SelectableCardsExample.tsx

```

### With `link` and `target`

A Card can be used with the purpose to navigate a user to an external page. To do that a user must pass a value to the `href` prop.
Optionally, the user can pass a `target` prop to control how the link should be open. By default `Card` is rendered as `article` html tag, in order to render it as a link, you should pass `as="a"` to `Card` component.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/WithLinkAndTargetExample.tsx

```

### With a custom drag handle

When using the `withDragHandle` prop on the Card, you can also pass a custom drag handle render function. This is useful for more advanced use cases such as supporting keyboard navigation, where you would want to handle key events on the drag handle component. When using a custom drag handle, you should pass `padding="none"` to the `Card` to make sure the drag handle does not render inside the Card's content.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/WithCustomDragHandle.tsx

```
