## Import

```js static=true
import { Card } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Card } from '@contentful/f36-card';
```

## Examples

Here you will find the most common ways of using the Card component.

### With `onClick`

Itâ€™s possible to call an action when the user clicks on the Card. To do that, you only need to pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/OnClickCardExample.tsx

```

### Selectable cards

Sometimes you will need to use the Card as an selectable element in the UI. To achieve that behaviour,
you should use a combination of the `onClick` and `selected` props. The former controlling the latter.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/SelectableCardsExample.tsx

```

### With `link` and `target`

A Card can be used with the purpose to navigate a user to an external page. To do that a user must pass a value to the `href` prop.
Optionally, the user can pass a `target` prop to control how the link should be open. By default `Card` is rendered as `article` html tag, in order to render it as a link, you should pass `as="a"` to `Card` component.

```jsx file=../../examples/Card/WithLinkAndTargetExample.tsx

```
