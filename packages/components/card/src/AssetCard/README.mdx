Display assets with preview and other options.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { AssetCard } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { AssetCard } from '@contentful/f36-card';
```

## Examples

The main props to show the content of your asset are `title` and `src`.
They both accept strings as values and `src` needs the url of the asset’s location.
To show a badge with the status of the entry,
you can pass one of "archived", "changed", "deleted", "draft", "new", or "published" to the `status` prop.

It’s also possible to pass the Asset’s type to the `type` prop. The allowed values are:

- archive
- audio
- code
- image
- markup
- pdf
- plaintext
- presentation
- richtext
- spreadsheet
- video

### Basic usage

```jsx file=../../examples/AssetCard/AssetCardExample.tsx

```

### Card actions

To show a `...` button with a menu in the card, pass an array of `MenuItem` components

```jsx file=../../examples/AssetCard/AssetCardActionsExample.tsx

```

### Loading state

```jsx file=../../examples/AssetCard/AssetCardLoadingExample.tsx

```

### Different sizes

```jsx file=../../examples/AssetCard/AssetCardSizesExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="AssetCard" />

## Content guidelines

Since this is a very opinionated component, we recommend using it only to show your assets.
Similar to how assets are shown in Contentful's fields or in rich text.

## Accessibility

It inherits the accessibility features of [Card](/components/card)
