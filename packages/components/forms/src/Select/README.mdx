Select allows users to make a single selection from an options menu.

Keep in mind that Select should not be used without the label.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Select } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Select } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Using as a controlled select

Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

For using the `Select` as a controlled component, you need to:

- Pass one of the options as the `value` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass a `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of `value`;

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectControlledExample.tsx

```

### Using as an uncontrolled select

Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.

You can use the `Select` as an uncontrolled component, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultValue` property, it will ensure that the select value can be altered normally.
- Don't set the `value` property as it will make the select controlled.

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectUncontrolledExample.tsx

```

### Select with label

In order to provide the best experience for your users consider using label that we provide for you in the [FormControl](/components/form-control)

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectWithLabelExample.tsx

```

### Select with validation

There might be cases where you would need to include the help text or validation message into your form. Read more about those elements in [FormControl documentation](/components/form-control)

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectWithValidationExample.tsx

```

### Select available sizes

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectSizes.tsx

```

### Select disabled state

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectDisabledExample.tsx

```

### Select with placeholder

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectPlaceholderExample.tsx

```

### Select with error

```tsx file=../../examples/SelectWithErrorExample.tsx

```

## Content guidelines

- Use `Select` to present many different options in one component
- When you have only a few options try to show them all at once, using [Radio](../components/radio).
- Use Select in Forms
- Order the list of options in a logical way, so it make sense for the user
- Don't use Select for a very long list of options, instead for those cases use [Autocomplete](../components/autocomplete)
- Options should be written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase).
- Options should be labeled in a clear way, so it's obvious what the option will do

### Select vs Dropdown

1. Dropdown menus are typically used for navigation or command menus, where an action is initiated based on the selection.
2. Select is a type of input, where the user is choosing one option from the list, typically used in Forms.

## Accessibility

- To ensure `Select` meets accessibility keyboard standards, set the `name` and `id` properties.
- The component should be wrapped in a `<FormControl>` and set a label via `<FormControl.Label`.
- Make use of `<FormControl.HelpText>` and `<FormControl.ValidationMessage>` to provide further context
- For more information about validation and controlling form fields, please refer to [FormControl](./form-control).

### Keyboard Usage

- Use the “arrow keys (“←”, ”↑”. “→”, and “↓”) + enter” to send the form.
- To switch between options with the keyboard, use the “tab + space” and the arrow keys.

## Props (API reference)

### Select

<PropsTable of="Select" />

### Select Option

<PropsTable of="Option" />

## Density support

This component supports multiple densities thanks to the [useDensity](/hooks/use-density) hook and automatically adjusts its styling for each density (when wrapped with the `DensityProvider`).

<Note variant="warning">
  High-density support solely available for the default size (medium).
</Note>
