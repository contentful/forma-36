`Textarea` is a form component that allows the user to enter a sizeable amount of multi-line plain text.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Textarea } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Textarea } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Using as a controlled input

Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

For using the `Textarea` as a controlled input, you need to:

- Pass `value` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of the input;

```jsx file=../../examples/TextareaControlledExample.tsx

```

### Using as an uncontrolled input

Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.

You can use the `Textarea` as an uncontrolled input, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultValue` property, it will ensure that the initial value of the input is set.
- Don't set the `value` as it will make the input controlled.

```jsx file=../../examples/TextareaUncontrolledExample.tsx

```

### Using outside of forms

When `Textarea` is used outside of form (without `FormControl`) and has no `<label>` associated with it, you need to specify `aria-label`.

### Different states

```jsx file=../../examples/TextareaStatesExample.tsx

```

## Accessibility

- To ensure `Textarea` meets accessibility keyboard standards, set the `name` and `id` properties.
- If you are using this component in a form, provide validation to the input and use `isInvalid` to control the error state of Textarea.
- The `invalid` and `disabled` states do not need to be set on FormControl but can be set in Textarea.
- In case the input is required, use `isRequired` prop.
- To display meaningful error messages make use of `<FormControl.ValidationMessage>`. For further details refer to [FormControl](./form-control).

## Props (API reference)

This component also accepts [relevant HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) as props. These include `rows`, `autoFocus` and `autoComplete`.
