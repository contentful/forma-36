`FormControl` is a wrapper component to enhance layout with input label, help text, counter or validation message.

## Import

```js static=true
import { FormControl } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { FormControl } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## How to use FormControl

- FormControl provides context to form elements: `isRequired`, `isDisabled`, `isInvalid`, `isReadOnly`
- Compound components of FormControl are: `Label`, `HelpText`, `ValidationMessage`, `Counter`. These components provide additional visual context and hints for users.
- For more information on how to use FormControl in Form, check the guide for [Form](/components/form).

## Design guidelines

To uphold a consistent look and experience for your application, we recommend following the same design layout guidelines for all inputs:

- `Label` is a required element that all your inputs should have to pass the a11y requirements. It should be placed on top of the input, so it would be first in your HTML structure.
- An input component should follow the label
- `HelpText` should appear under the input, when you need to display some additional information to the user
- `ValidationMessage` should be appearing directly under the input or under `HelpText` if displayed, to clearly indicate that it is invalid
- `TextInput` and `Textarea` components can have an option of counting characters. In that case, we recommend aligning HelpText and Counter by using the Flex component and placed them right below the input. Have a look on the example over [here](#example-with-character-count)

## Density support
