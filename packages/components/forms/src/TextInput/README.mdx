`TextInput` is a form component, that allows users to input text or numbers and should be used in a form context.

`TextInput` is supporting different types of inputs, like `text`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `search`, `url`, where `text` is the default.

## Import

```js static=true
import { TextInput } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { TextInput } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Using as a controlled input

Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

For using the `TextInput` as a controlled input, you need to:

- Pass `value` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of the input;

```jsx file=../../examples/TextInputControlledExample.tsx

```

### Using as an uncontrolled input

Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.

You can use the `TextInput` as an uncontrolled input, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultValue` property, it will ensure that the initial value of the input is set.
- Don't set the `value` as it will make the input controlled.

```jsx file=../../examples/TextInputUncontrolledExample.tsx

```

### Using outside of forms

When `TextInput` is used outside of form (without `FormControl`) and has no `<label>` associated with it, you need to specify `aria-label`.

### With action buttons

`TextInput.Group` enables the user to set a button at the start or end of an input, with some spacing or collapsed.
Example of usage:

```jsx file=../../examples/TextInputGroupExample.tsx

```

### Different states

```jsx file=../../examples/TextInputStatesExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

### TextInput

<PropsTable of="TextInput" />

### TextInput.Group

<PropsTable of="InputGroup" />

## Content guidelines

- Use direct and succinct copy that helps a user to successfully complete a form
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)

## Accessibility

- To ensure `TextInput` meets accessibility standards, provide `name` and `id`
- Keep in mind that to provide that accessible inputs, you need to use labels.
- If you decide, that for some reason you would not use the label, please provide `aria-label` attribute to make it accessible for technologies like screen readers.
