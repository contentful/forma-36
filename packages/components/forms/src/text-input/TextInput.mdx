Use TextInput to give users the possibility to select only one option from a number of choices. It contains a radio input with its label. If needed the component can display an error message and hint message. For a multiple-choice, please consider using [CheckboxField component](https://f36.contentful.com/components/checkbox-field/).

`TextInput` is a form component, that allows users to input text or numbers and should be used in a form context.

## How to use TextInput

The TextInput component can be configured in a number of different ways. Use this guidance to determine the correct variation based on the context.

TextInput is supporting different types of inputs, like `'text' | 'email' | 'file' | 'number' | 'password' | 'search' | 'url'`, where `text` is a default.

## Code examples

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <TextInput
    type="email"
    labelText="Email address"
    helpText="Please enter your email address"
    isRequired
  />
</React.Fragment>
```

## TextInput variations

### Help text and validation message

TextInput is able to display additional information for users like `helpText` or `validationMessage`

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <TextInput
    type="email"
    labelText="E-mail address"
    helpText="Enter your email address"
    validationMessage="Enter email in the correct format xxx@xxxx.xxx"
    isRequired
  />
</React.Fragment>
```

### Additional TextLink (`link`)

The TextInput can be configured to display an additional TextLink in the label.

```jsx
<TextInput
  type="password"
  label="Set a password"
  name="password"
  id="password-field"
  placeholder="Password"
  link={
    <TextLink icon={<LockIcon />} href="https://f36.contentful.com/">
      go to link
    </TextLink>
  }
/>
```

### Character count (`countCharacters`)

The TextInput can be configured to display a character count. This is useful when an input field has a character limit.<br/>
**Note**: The `maxLength` property must be also provided.

```jsx
<TextInput
  type="text"
  label="Name"
  name="name"
  id="name-field"
  placeholder="Name"
  countCharacters
  maxLength={150}
  link={
    <TextLink icon={<LockIcon />} href="https://f36.contentful.com/">
      go to link
    </TextLink>
  }
/>
```

### TextInput with copy button (`withCopyButton`)

We provide a variant of the TextInput that is a composed with CopyButton. In order to use it add `withCopyButton` property to your implementation.

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="My amazing label"
  name="someOtherOption"
  value="someOtherValue"
  id="myField"
  placeholder="This is such a great input"
  countCharacters
  maxLength={20}
  validationMessage="It's great but you need to fix something"
  withCopyButton
  link={
    <TextLink icon={<LockIcon />} href="https://f36.contentful.com/">
      go to link
    </TextLink>
  }
/>
```

### TextInput standalone (`isStandalone`)

You might need to use TextInput without our label to meet some of your design requirements. In that case, use the property `isStandalone`. The property `label` will be still required, but we would pass it as `aria-label` so it meets the accessibility requirements.

```jsx
<TextInput
  type="text"
  label="Name"
  name="name"
  id="name-field"
  placeholder="Name"
  countCharacters
  maxLength={150}
  link={
    <TextLink icon={<LockIcon />} href="https://f36.contentful.com/">
      go to link
    </TextLink>
  }
  isStandalone
/>
```

## Content recommendations

- Use direct, succinct copy that helps the user to successfully complete the form
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- In cases where additional context is unnecessary, help text can be substituted for text in the label
- Do not use punctuation for labels, help text and links
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)

## Accessibility

- To ensure `TextInput` meets accessibility standards, provide `name` and `id`
