## How to use TextInput

The TextInput component can be configured in a number of different ways. Use this guidance to determine the correct variation based on the context.

TextInput is supporting different types of inputs, like `'text' | 'email' | 'file' | 'number' | 'password' | 'search' | 'url'`, where `text` is the default.

## Code examples

### Basic example

```jsx
<TextInput
  type="email"
  name="email"
  label="Email address"
  aria-label="Email input"
/>
```

### TextInput with label

In order to create a correct text input the recommendation is to add a label to any kind of input. In order to do that, we provide you couple of additional components that you can use to compose your inputs with labels, help or validation messages.
Read more about [`FormControl`](/components/form-control)

```jsx
<FormControl>
  <FormControl.Label>Add your email</FormControl.Label>
  <TextInput
    type="email"
    name="email"
    label="Email address"
    placeholder="Email"
  />
  <FormControl.HelpText>Provide your email</FormControl.HelpText>
  <FormControl.ValidationMessage>
    Format of the email is not correct
  </FormControl.ValidationMessage>
</FormControl>
```

## TextInput variations

Keep in mind, that if you need to use an input without a label, you need to pass `aria-label` attribute to create an input that would be accessibile to assistive technologies, like screen readers.

### TextInput with placeholder

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Token"
  name="token"
  id="input-2"
  aria-label="token"
  placeholder="Token"
/>
```

### TextInput disabled

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Token"
  name="token"
  id="input-2"
  aria-label="token"
  isDisabled
/>
```

### TextInput invalid

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Token"
  name="token"
  id="input-2"
  aria-label="token"
  isInvalid
/>
```

### TextInput with copy button

We provide a variant of the TextInput that is a composed with CopyButton. In order to use it add `withCopyButton` property to your implementation.

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Token"
  name="token"
  id="input-2"
  withCopyButton
  aria-label="token"
/>
```

## Content recommendations

- Use direct and succinct copy that helps the user to successfully complete the form
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)

## Accessibility

- To ensure `TextInput` meets accessibility standards, provide `name` and `id`
- Keep in mind that to provide that accessibile inputs, you need to use labels.
- if you decide, that for some reason you would not use the label, please provide `aria-label` attribute to make it accessibile for technologies like screen readers.

## Props
