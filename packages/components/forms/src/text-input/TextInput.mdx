## How to use TextInput

The TextInput component can be configured in a number of different ways. Use this guidance to determine the correct variation based on the context.

TextInput is supporting different types of inputs, like `'text' | 'email' | 'file' | 'number' | 'password' | 'search' | 'url'`, where `text` is the default.
Label property is always required and passed to the `<input />` as `aria-label`.

## Code examples

```jsx
<TextInput type="email" name="email" label="Email address" />
```

## TextInput variations

### Character count (`countCharacters`)

The TextInput can be configured to display a character count. This is useful when an input field has a character limit.<br/>
**Note**: The `maxLength` property must be also provided.

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="name"
  name="name"
  id="input-1"
  placeholder="Type your name"
  countCharacters
  maxLength={150}
/>
```

### TextInput with copy button (`withCopyButton`)

We provide a variant of the TextInput that is a composed with CopyButton. In order to use it add `withCopyButton` property to your implementation.

```jsx
<TextInput label="Token" name="token" id="input-2" withCopyButton />
```

## Content recommendations

- Use direct and succinct copy that helps the user to successfully complete the form
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)

## Accessibility

- To ensure `TextInput` meets accessibility standards, provide `name` and `id`
- Keep in mind that to provide that accessibile inputs, you need to use labels.

## Props

import { Props } from '@contentful/f36-docs-utils';

<Props of="TextInput" />
