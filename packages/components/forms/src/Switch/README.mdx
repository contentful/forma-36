Switch is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Use it when a setting requires an on/off or show/hide function to display the results; user needs to perform instantaneous actions that do not need a review or confirmation; user is toggling independent features or behaviors.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Switch } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Switch } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Using as a controlled input

Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

For using the Switch as a controlled input, you need to:

- Pass the `isChecked` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass a `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of `isChecked`;

Setting the `isChecked` will already define it as a controlled input.

```jsx file=../../examples/SwitchControlledExample.tsx

```

### Using as an uncontrolled input

Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.

You can use the Switch as an uncontrolled input, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultChecked` property, it will ensure that the checked state can be altered normally.
- Don't set the `isChecked` as it will make the input controlled.

```jsx file=../../examples/SwitchUncontrolledExample.tsx

```

### Switch vs Checkbox

Switch is a two-step action: selection and execution, whereas checkbox is just selection of an option and its execution usually requires another control.

```jsx file=../../examples/SwitchVsCheckboxExample.tsx

```

### Switch disabled

```jsx file=../../examples/SwitchCheckboxDisabled.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="Switch" />

## Accessibility

- Use clear and concise label for Switch component
- If needed provide additional information for the user if Switch will cause a change in the context
