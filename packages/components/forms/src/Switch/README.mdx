Switch is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Switch works like a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off, like a light switch.

## How to use Switch

- use when a setting requires an on/off or show/hide function to display the results
- use when user needs to perform instantaneous actions that do not need a review or confirmation
- use when user is toggling independent features or behaviors

### Using as a controlled input

For using the Switch as a controlled input, you need to:

- Pass the `isChecked` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass a `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of `isChecked`;

Setting the `isChecked` will already define it as a controlled input.

```jsx static=true
const ExampleControlled = () => {
  const [switchState, setSwitchState] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Switch
      name="allow-cookies-controlled"
      id="allow-cookies-controlled"
      isChecked={switchState}
      onChange={() => setSwitchState((prevState) => !prevState)}
    >
      Allow cookies
    </Switch>
  );
};
```

### Using as an uncontrolled input

You can use the Switch as an uncontrolled input, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultChecked` property, it will ensure that the checked state can be altered normally.
- Don't set the `isChecked` as it will make the input controlled.

```jsx static=true
<Switch
  type="checkbox"
  name="allow-cookies-uncontrolled"
  id="allow-cookies-uncontrolled"
  defaultChecked={true}
>
  Allow cookies
</Switch>
```

### Switch vs Checkbox

Switch is a two-step action: selection and execution, whereas checkbox is just selection of an option and its execution usually requires another control.

## Code examples

```jsx
<Switch id="testSwitch1" name="testSwitch1">
  label for switch
</Switch>
```

### Switch disabled

```jsx
<Switch id="testSwitch2" name="testSwitch2" isDisabled>
  label for switch
</Switch>
```

## Accessibility

- use clear and concise label for Switch component
- if needed provide additional information for the user if Switch will cause a change in the context

## Props

import { Props } from '@contentful/f36-docs-utils';

<Props of="Switch" />
