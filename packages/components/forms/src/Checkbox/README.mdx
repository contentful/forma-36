`Checkbox` is a form component that shows a checkbox with it's label. `Checkbox.Group` is a component that makes it easier to handle group of checkboxes.

If you want to allow a user to select only one out of multiple options, use the [Radio](/components/radio) component.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Checkbox } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Checkbox } from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Using as a controlled input

Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

For using the Checkbox as a controlled input, you need to:

- Pass the `isChecked` property, with this property it will already be a controlled component;
- Pass a `onChange` handler, so you can use it to update the value of `isChecked`;

Setting the `isChecked` will already define it as a controlled input.

```jsx file=../../examples/CheckboxControlledExample.tsx

```

### Using as an uncontrolled input

Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.

You can use the Checkbox as an uncontrolled input, for that you can:

- Set the `defaultChecked` property, it will ensure that the checked state can be altered normally.
- Don't set the `isChecked` as it will make the input controlled.

```jsx file=../../examples/CheckboxUncontrolledExample.tsx

```

### Using with Group

We also provide the `Checkbox.Group` component that helps when using multiple checkboxes. You can pass some common properties on the `Checkbox.Group` level and they will be passed to the checkboxes inside the group.

- `spacing`: This will set how much space should be between the inputs;
- `name`: By setting this property on the `Checkbox.Group` level, you will set it automatically for all the checkboxes in the group;
- `defaultValue`: This accepts an array that set the `defaultChecked` property for checkboxes which the value exists in the array;
- `value`: Same as `defaultValue` but this one sets the `isChecked` property, making the checkbox group controlled;
- `onChange`: Handler that will be executed when any checkbox inside the group receives the event of change.

`Checkbox.Group` is a **recommended** way of using `Checkbox` when using it within forms.

```jsx file=../../examples/CheckboxGroupExample.tsx

```

### Checked or indeterminate

The Checkbox can be rendered as indeterminate or checked, with the `isIndeterminate`, and `isChecked` or `defaultChecked` properties.
Note that providing the `isChecked` makes it a controlled input, requiring an `onChange` handler.

```jsx file=../../examples/CheckboxCheckedOrIndeterminateExample.tsx

```

### Disabled

The Checkbox can be rendered as disabled with the `isDisabled` property.

```jsx file=../../examples/CheckboxDisabledExample.tsx

```

## Content guidelines

- Use direct, succinct copy that helps the user to successfully complete the form
- Do not use punctuation for labels
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)

## Accessibility

- To ensure `Checkbox` meets accessibility standards, provide `name` and `id`;
- When using `Checkbox.Group` it should be wrapped in a `<FormControl as="fieldset">` and have a `<FormControl.Label as="legend">`.
