## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="Badge" />

`Badge` also accepts all HTML attributes (as React properties) that are applicable to the usual `div` tag.

## Content guidelines

- badges are used to inform users of the status of an element in the interface
- keep in mind the recommended color coding for each of variant
- try to use labels with short, scannable text
- try to use a single word to describe the status of an element
- try to describe the status in the past tense, like changed or archived

## Accessibility

- text must be clear enough for color-blind users to be able to understand immediately without needing to rely only on the color.
