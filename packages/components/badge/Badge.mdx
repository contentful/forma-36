## How to use Badge

## Component variants

### Badge types

- **Primary** - used for the entity that has been changed

```jsx
<Badge variant="primary">changed</Badge>
```

- **Primary filled** - used to highlight a new functionality or to indicate changes in the interface.

```jsx
<Badge variant="primary-filled">new</Badge>
```

- **Positive** - used for the entity that has been published

```jsx
<Badge variant="positive">published</Badge>
```

- **Negative** - used for the entity that has been deleted.

```jsx
<Badge variant="negative">deleted</Badge>
```

- **Warning** - used for the entity that has been deleted.

```jsx
<Badge variant="warning">draft</Badge>
```

- **Secondary** - used for all the secondary elements, for example in the list of versions:

```jsx
<Badge variant="secondary">current</Badge>
```

- **Featured** - used for featured entities that should be highlighted.

```jsx
<Badge variant="featured">trial</Badge>
```

### Badge sizes

- **default**

```jsx
<Badge variant="positive">published</Badge>
```

- **small**

```jsx
<Badge variant="primary-filled" size="small">
  new
</Badge>
```

## Content recommendations

- try to use labels with short, scannable text
- try to use a single word to describe the status of an element
- try to describe the status in the past tense, like changed or archived

## Accessibility

- text must be clear enough for color-blind users to be able to understand immediately without needing to rely only on the color.

## Props

import { Props } from '@contentful/f36-docs-utils';

<Props of="Badge" />

`Badge` also accepts all HTML attributes (as React properties) that are applicable to the usual `div` tag.
