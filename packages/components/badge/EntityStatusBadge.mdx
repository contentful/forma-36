import { Props } from '@contentful/f36-docs-utils';

EntityStatusBadge is used to indicate entity status in Contentful apps. A component is based on our [Badge](../components/badge) component and has a built-in mapping of entity status to a badge variant.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { EntityStatusBadge } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { EntityStatusBadge } from '@contentful/f36-badge';
```

## Examples

EntityStatusBadge can have different mark following statuses. Those values are passed as a `entityStatus` property and displayed as a content in the badge:

- published
- draft
- archived
- changed
- deleted
- new

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="published" />
```

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="draft" />
```

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="archived" />
```

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="changed" />
```

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="deleted" />
```

```tsx
<EntityStatusBadge entityStatus="new" />
```

## Props (API reference)

<Props
  of="EntityStatusBadge"
  storybookPath="/story/components-entitystatusbadge"
/>

## Content guidelines

- try to use labels with short, scannable text
- try to use a single word to describe the status of an element
- try to describe the status in the past tense, like changed or archived

## Accessibility

- text must be clear enough for color-blind users to be able to understand immediately without needing to rely only on the color.
