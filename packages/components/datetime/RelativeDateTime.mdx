In `@contentful/f36-datetime`, there are two components (`DateTime` and `RelativeDateTime`) that will return a date following [Forma 36 guidelines](https://f36.contentful.com/guidelines/date-and-time/).

## RelativeDateTime

Provides a relative date string for resolutions ranging from seconds up through years. Should be used when absolute date and time is unnecessarily specific.

### Examples

If we consider today as August 18th of 2021 and we use pass the following values to the Component

```tsx
<Grid rowGap="spacingXs" rows="repeat(3, auto)" justifyContent="start">
  {/* passing a Timestamp as an ISOString */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" />
  {/* passing a JS Date */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={new Date()} />
  {/* passing a Unix Epoch in milliseconds */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={1629240300000} />
</Grid>
```

The component will display `a day ago`

### Passing a `baseDate`

Normally, the component compare your `date` with todayâ€™s date. But if you want to compare it to some specific date provide `baseDate` prop.

```tsx
<RelativeDateTime baseDate="2021-08-17T15:45" date="2021-08-18T15:45" />
```

The component will display `in a day`

### Using `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

Still using the last example. If you only need a relative date if the given date is within the current week,
that is possible by using the boolean `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

```tsx
<Grid rowGap="spacingXs" rows="repeat(3, auto)" justifyContent="start">
  {/* It will display "Yesterday at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
  {/* It willdisplay "5 hours ago" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-18T10:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
  {/* It will display "Tomorrow at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-18T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
</Grid>
```

## Props of RelativeDateTime

<Props of="RelativeDateTime" />
