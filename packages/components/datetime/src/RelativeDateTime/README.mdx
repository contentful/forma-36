In `@contentful/f36-datetime`, there are two components (`DateTime` and `RelativeDateTime`) that will return a date.

## RelativeDateTime

Provides a relative date string for resolutions ranging from seconds up through years. Should be used when absolute date and time is unnecessarily specific.

### Examples

We can pass a date as either an ISO 8601 string, a Date object, or a UNIX Epoch time.

```tsx
<Stack flexDirection="column">
  {/* passing a timestamp as an ISO string */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" />
  {/* passing a JS Date */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={new Date()} />
  {/* passing a UNIX Epoch */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={1629240300000} />
</Stack>
```

### Passing a `baseDate`

Normally, the component compares your `date` with today’s date. If you want to compare it to some specific date
you need to provide `baseDate` prop.

```tsx
<RelativeDateTime baseDate="2021-08-17T15:45" date="2021-08-18T15:45" />
```

The component will display `in a day`

### Using `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

You can set isRelativeToCurrentWeek to true if you want to indicate that the date is relative only within a week.
And if the difference is more than one week, just show the date without relativeness.
It will compare the date to today or `baseDate` if provided.

```tsx
<Stack flexDirection="column">
  {/* It will display "Yesterday at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime
    baseDate="2021-08-18T15:45"
    date="2021-08-17T15:45"
    isRelativeToCurrentWeek
  />
  {/* It will display "5 hours ago" */}
  <RelativeDateTime
    baseDate="2021-08-18T15:45"
    date="2021-08-18T10:45"
    isRelativeToCurrentWeek
  />
  {/* It will display "Tomorrow at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime
    baseDate="2021-08-18T15:45"
    date="2021-08-19T15:45"
    isRelativeToCurrentWeek
  />
  {/* It will display "1 Aug 2021" */}
  <RelativeDateTime
    baseDate="2021-08-18T15:45"
    date="2021-08-01T15:45"
    isRelativeToCurrentWeek
  />
</Stack>
```
