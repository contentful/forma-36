In `@contentful/f36-datetime`, there are two components (`DateTime` and `RelativeDateTime`) that will return a date.

## RelativeDateTime

Provides a relative date string for resolutions ranging from seconds up through years. Should be used when absolute date and time is unnecessarily specific.

### Examples

If we consider today as of August 18th of 2021 and we pass the following values to the `<RelativeDateTime />` component

```tsx
<Stack flexDirection="column">
  {/* passing a Timestamp as an ISOString */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" />
  {/* passing a JS Date */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={new Date()} />
  {/* passing a Unix Epoch in milliseconds */}
  <RelativeDateTime date={1629240300000} />
</Stack>
```

The component will display `a day ago`

### Passing a `baseDate`

Normally, the component compares your `date` with todayâ€™s date. If you want to compare it to some specific date
you need to provide `baseDate` prop.

```tsx
<RelativeDateTime baseDate="2021-08-17T15:45" date="2021-08-18T15:45" />
```

The component will display `in a day`

### Using `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

You can set isRelativeToCurrentWeek to true if you want to indicate that the date is relative only within a week.
And if the difference is more than one week, just show the date without relativeness.
It will compare the date to today or baseDate if provided.

```tsx
<Stack flexDirection="column">
  {/* It will display "Yesterday at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
  {/* It will display "5 hours ago" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-18T10:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
  {/* It will display "Tomorrow at 3:45 PM" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-19T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
  {/* It will display "1 Aug 2021" */}
  <RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-01T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />
</Stack>
```

## Props of RelativeDateTime

<Props of="RelativeDateTime" />
