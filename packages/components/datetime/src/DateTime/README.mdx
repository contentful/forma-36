## Import

```jsx static=true
import { DateTime } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { DateTime } from '@contentful/f36-datetime';
```

## Formats

The DateTime component will format any date to a human friendly format and wrap it in a `<time>` tag.
It allows four different forms of display that can be controlled by changing the `format` prop:

| `format` option   | Result                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `full`            | 12 Aug 2020 at 8:00 AM    |
| `fullWithSeconds` | 12 Aug 2020 at 8:00:00 AM |
| `day`             | 12 Aug 2020               |
| `time`            | 8:00 AM                   |
| `weekday`         | Wed, 12 Aug               |

## Examples

### Passing a Timestamp as an ISOString

```jsx file=../../examples/ISOStringExample.tsx

```

### Passing a JS Date

```jsx file=../../examples/JSDateExample.tsx

```

### Passing a Unix Epoch in milliseconds

```jsx file=../../examples/UnixEpochExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="DateTime" />

## Content guidelines

- `full` should be displayed without commas and as human-readable as possible.
- `weekday` should be used when it's helpful for users to see weekdays.
- Dates should be displayed in order of day-month-year, with month abbreviated and without punctuation,
  to increase scannability and to strike a compromise between different localized date formats.
- To show a date or time range, use an **en dash** (Unicode: U+2013, html: &ndash;) with spaces around it (e.g. 8:00 am – 2:00 pm, 8 Jul – 13 Aug 2019).

## Accessibility

The component uses the `time` tag that provides a machine readable date.
