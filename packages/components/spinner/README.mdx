# Spinner

A Spinner is a graphic element that helps communicating to users that an action is in progress and it will take some time to be completed.

```jsx
<Spinner />
```

## Code examples

### With text

It’s possible to use the Spinner with other elements. A very common pattern is using it together with text.

```jsx
<div>
  Loading <Spinner />
</div>
```

Another good example of the Spinner being used with other components is the loading state of `Button` component.

## Props

<PropsTable of="Spinner" />
