// or

## Examples

### Basic usage

The Multiselect is a fully controlled from element and expects the selectable items as children via the compund component Multiselect.Option.

Properties are:

for the multiselect itself:

- currentSelection (optional but recommendet): an array of the labels of selected options. This will give the user a hint that there are selected items. This is optional
- placeholder (optional): Label of the trigger button without selected elements
- startIcon (optional): Icon on the start of the trigger button
- listWidth (optional): auto or full
- listMaxHeight (optional): sets the maximum height of the list drawer, overflow will be scrolled
- isLoading: enables showing a loading animation while searching or loading results

It also accepts refs for the toggle button, the searchInput and the list.

For the option:

- itemId: identifier for the element, used to link the label with the checkbox
- value: the actual value of the select option
- label: displayed label
- onSelectItem: This function is called when the user selects a option, it needs to be passed to the MultiselectOption
- isChecked (optional): controlls if a element is initially selected
- isDisabled (optional): controlls if a element is changeable

```jsx file=./examples/MultiselectBasicUsageExample.tsx

```

### Searchable options

One of optional feature of the Multiselect component is to allow filtering the list via a search field.
To make it work, the property hasSearch needs to be set to true and a onSearchValueChange callback function needs to be provided.

To enable searching the following properties have to be set.

- hasSearch: enables filtering of the list
- onSearchValueChange: required callback function when hasSearch is true. This function needs to provide the search /filter algorithm
- searchPlaceholder (optional): placeholder for the search field
- noMatchesMessage (optional): message shown when search result is empty

```
