## Examples

### Basic usage

The Multiselect is a fully controlled from element and expects the selectable items via the compund component <Multiselect.Option>.

Properties are:

for the multiselect itself:

- currentSelection: an array of the labels of selected options. This will give the user a hint that there are selected items. This is optional
- placeholder: Label of the trigger button
- startIcon: Icon on the start of the trigger button
- hasSearch: enables filtering of the list
- onSearchValueChange: required when hasSearch is true
-

For the option:

- itemId: identifier for the element
- value: the actual value of the select option
- label: displayed label
- `onSelectItem`: This function is called when the user selects a option, it needs to be passed to the MultiselectOption
- isChecked: controlls if a element is initially selected
- isDisabled: controlls if a element is changeable

```jsx file=./examples/MultiselectBasicUsageExample.tsx

```

### Searchable options

One of optional feature of the Multiselect component is to allow filtering the list via a search field.
To make it work, the property hasSearch needs to be set to true and a onSearchValueChange callback function needs to be provided.
