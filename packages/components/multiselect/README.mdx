Multiselect allows users to make a multi selection from a list of options.
It has multiple optional features like a search.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { Multiselect } from '@contentful/f36-multiselect';
```

## Examples

### Basic usage

The Multiselect is a fully controlled form element and expects the selectable items as children via the compound component Multiselect.Option.

Properties are:

For the multiselect itself:

- currentSelection (optional but recommended): an array of the labels of selected options. This will give the user a hint that there are selected items. This is optional
- placeholder (optional): Label of the trigger button without selected elements
- startIcon (optional): Icon on the start of the trigger button
- isLoading: enables showing a loading animation while searching or loading results

Inherited propertys from Popover Component.

- listWidth (optional): auto or full
- listMaxHeight (optional): sets the maximum height of the list drawer, overflow will be scrolled

It also accepts refs for the toggle button, the searchInput and the list.

For the option:

- itemId: identifier for the element, used to link the label with the checkbox
- value: the actual value of the select option
- label: displayed label
- onSelectItem: This function is called when the user selects a option, it needs to be passed to the MultiselectOption
- isChecked (optional): controlls if a element is initially selected
- isDisabled (optional): controlls if a element is changeable

```jsx file=./examples/MultiselectBasicUsageExample.tsx

```

### Searchable options

One optional feature of the Multiselect component is to allow filtering the list via a search field.
To make it work, the onSearchValueChange callback function needs to be provided.

To enable searching the following properties have to be set.

- onSearchValueChange: Callbackfunction which enables the search field. This function needs to provide the search /filter algorithm
- searchPlaceholder (optional): placeholder for the search field
- noMatchesMessage (optional): message shown when search result is empty

```jsx file=./examples/MultiselectSearchExample.tsx

```

### SelectAll Option

To offer a shortcut for selecting and deselecting all options, you can use the compound component SelectAll. This requires a callback function which needs to contain your implementation for selecting all options.

```jsx file=./examples/MultiselectSelectAllExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="Multiselect" />

## Content guidelines

- Multiselect placeholder should be short but descriptive.
- Multiselect options can come from a simple array of strings or more complex objects.
- Do not use the index position of the items in the filtered array for keys or ids, as they are going to change while filtering.
- Use any algorithm you like in order to search and filter. Depending on your implementation you can also generate a new request to your dataset based on the users input.

## Accessibility

- When focussing the toggle button, the enter key opens it. The dropdown content automatically will be focussed
- Pressing the space bar toggles the checked state of an option and will trigger the onSelectItem callback function
