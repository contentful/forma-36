Menu is a component that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or links.
Menu uses Popover component as a base.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { Menu } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

You can use following components to build a menu:

1. `<Menu>`: The main wrapper that provides nested components with all the context and state.
1. `<Menu.Trigger>` The wrapper for the menu list trigger. Must be a direct child of `<Menu>`.  
   NOTE: 🚨 Ensure that the component that you pass accepts `ref`. Consider using `forwardRef` for functional components.
1. `<Menu.List>`: The wrapper for the menu items. Must be a direct child of `<Menu>`.
1. `<Menu.Item>` The trigger that handles menu selection. Must be a direct child of `<Menu.List>`.
1. `<Menu.Divider>` A visual separator for menu items.
1. `<Menu.SectionTitle>` A title that you can use in the menu list.
1. `<Menu.ListHeader>` The wrapper for one menu item that will be sticked to the top of the menu list. `<Menu.Item>` must be provided as a child.
1. `<Menu.ListFooter>` The wrapper for one menu item that will be sticked to the bottom of the menu list. `<Menu.Item>` must be provided as a child.
1. `<Menu.Submenu>` The wrapper for for submenu components. Structure of the children remains the same like in `<Menu>`, except you should use `<Menu.SubmenuTrigger>` instead of `<Menu.Trigger>`.
1. `<Menu.SubmenuTrigger>` The wrapper for the submenu list trigger. Must be a direct child of `<Menu.Submenu>`.

### Basic usage

```tsx file=examples/BasicMenu.tsx

```

### With simple Button as a trigger

```tsx file=examples/MenuWithButtonAsTrigger.tsx

```

### With Menu.SectionTitle and Menu.Divider

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithTitle.tsx

```

### Controlled Menu

By default the Menu component is uncontrolled. So when user clicks on the trigger, the menu opens/closes.
But you can control it by passing `isOpen` prop and `onClose`, `onOpen` callbacks.

```jsx file=examples/ControlledMenu.tsx

```

### Controlled Menu with custom trigger onClick callback

In most cases, you will use the [controlled approach](#controlled-menu).
But if you have to provide your own toggle menu logic on the trigger component, you can do this by providing `onClick` callback on trigger component and omitting `onOpen` callback on the Menu component.

```jsx file=examples/ControlledMenuWithCustomTriggerLogic.tsx

```

### With Menu list maximum height

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithMaxHeight.tsx

```

### With active and disabled items

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithActiveAndDisabledItems.tsx

```

### With menu open by default

```jsx static=true file=examples/MenuOpenByDefault.tsx

```

### With sticky header and footer

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithStickyHeaderFooter.tsx

```

### With React Router links

```jsx static=true file=examples/MenuWithReactRouterLinks.tsx

```

### With predefined focused menu item

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithPredefinedFocusedMenuItem.tsx

```

### With submenu

By default props like `closeOnSelect`, `closeOnBlur`, `closeOnEsc` that you pass to `Menu` will be shared to all submenus
but you can redefine them on any submenu by passing those props directly to that `Submenu`.

```jsx file=examples/MenuWithSubmenu.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

### Menu

<PropsTable of="Menu" />

### Menu.Item

<PropsTable of="MenuItem" />

### Menu.List

<PropsTable of="MenuList" />

## Content guidelines

- Use an interactive element such as `button` for `Menu.Trigger`

## Accessibility

- When the menu is opened, focus is moved to the first menu item. Or to the one that has `isInitiallyFocused` prop set to `true`.
- When the menu is closed, focus returned back to the trigger element.
- You can use arrow keys (`ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown`) to navigate through menu items.
- When the menu is open, click on `Esc` key will close the popover. If you set `closeOnEsc` to `false`, it will not close.
- When the menu is open, click outside menu or blurring out will close the menu. If you set `closeOnBlur` to `false`, it will not close.
- All the necessary a11y attributes for `Menu.List`, `Menu.Trigger` and `Menu.Item` are provided.
