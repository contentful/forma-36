## Content guidelines

- The title should be a short message that summarize the content of the accordion.
- Anything can be passed as the content of the accordion, but often organizing it with Texts and Tables would be enough.
- When using headings, be mindful about the heading levels. The header is a Subheading with `h2` tag.

- It allows keyboard navigation to open and close the accordions
