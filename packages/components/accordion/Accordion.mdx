Accordions are a good way to deliver a large amount of information. An accordion is a list of headers that after being clicked reveal or hide more content related to them.
The header gives the user a summary of the content and the user decides if they need to see the extended content or not.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { Accordion } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

The title prop accepts React nodes, but we recommend that only Typography components are used.
Since the whole header is a button, do not use Buttons or Links in the title prop. The only click event that should exist is the header's event.

### Basic usage

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item title="What payment methods do you accept?">
    <Text>
      Customers on the Team tier can pay with a credit card (American Express,
      MasterCard or Visa). Enterprise customers have the choice of paying with a
      credit card or wire transfer.
    </Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Using it with other components

Other typographic components can be passed as the accordion's title and anything can be used as the accordion's content. For example:

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item
    title={<SectionHeading>What payment methods do you accept?</SectionHeading>}
  >
    <Text marginBottom="spacingS">
      Customers on the Team tier can pay with a credit card (American Express,
      MasterCard or Visa). Enterprise customers have the choice of paying with a
      credit card or wire transfer.
    </Text>
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')}>Accordionâ€™s button</Button>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Props (API reference)

### Accordion

<Props of="Accordion" />

### AccordionItem

<Props of="Accordion.Item" />

## Content guidelines

- The title should be a short message that summarize the content of the accordion.
- Anything can be passed as the content of the accordion, but often organizing it with Texts and Tables would be enough.
- When using headings, be mindful about the heading levels. The header is a Subheading with `h2` tag.

## Accessibility

- It allows keyboard navigation to open and close the accordions
