`useKeyboard` is a simple hook that accepts a reference to a component and attaches event listener to the component. By default attaches to `document`. Adds/remove the events on mount and unmount, and emits callback functions.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { useKeyboard } from '@contentful/f36-utils';
```

## Examples

### Basic example

By passing ref of `Stack` element to `useKeyboard` hook, you create event listeners, listed in `keys` prop. When focus is inside the `Stack` element, and one of the listed keyboard actions is triggered, the callback is called. In this example, it's function `handleEvent`.

```jsx
() => {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  const handleEvent = (eventName, event) => console.log(eventName, event);

  useKeyboard({
    event: 'keydown',
    ref: ref,
    keys: {
      ArrowUp: (e) => handleEvent('ArrowUp', e),
      Tab: (e) => handleEvent('Tab', e),
    },
  });

  return (
    <Stack flexDirection="column" ref={ref}>
      <Button>Button 1</Button>
      <Button>Button 2</Button>
      <Button>Button 3</Button>
    </Stack>
  );
};
```

## Props (API reference)

<Props of="useKeyboard" />

## Accessibility

This hook allows to implement keyboard accessibility according to many different requirements. To see most common interactions, check [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Grid_Role#keyboard_interactions).
