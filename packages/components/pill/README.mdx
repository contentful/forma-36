  tabIndex={0}
  testId="pill-item"
  label="test label"
  onClose={() => {}}
  onDrag={() => {}}
/>
```

// import { Pill, Icon } from '@contentful/f36-pill';

<Pill
  label="example.user@contentful.com"
  dragHandleComponent={
    <Icon
      icon="ArrowUp"
      color="positive"
      style={{ padding: '0.375rem 0.625rem' }}
    />
  }
/>
```

## Content recommendations:

- Be sure the pill text is clear and concise.

## Accessibility

- Label value is passed in the component as a title in the span element, like follows `title={label}`.
- The default drag component has a `aria-label="Drag handler"`, custom components should also include an `aria-label`

## Props

<Props of="Pill" />
