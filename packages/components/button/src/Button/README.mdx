Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user clicks them.
They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways.
They contain a text label to describe the action, and an icon if appropriate.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-button';
```

## Examples

### Variants

Button has 5 different variants:

- **Primary** - Used for the most important actions in any scenario. Donâ€™t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Secondary** - Used for secondary actions, the most commonly used button type.
- **Positive** - For use when the action has a positive connotation such as creating or publishing a new entity.
- **Negative** - For destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.
- **Transparent** - For having an unstylized button.

### Rendered as `a` tag

By default, button is rendered as a `button` tag. But you can change it to `a` tag, by providing `as` prop. Don't forget to pass `href` prop as well.

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonAsAExample.tsx

```

### With icons

You can add an icon by providing the following props:

- `startIcon` - adds icon to the left side of the button
- `endIcon` - adds icon to the right side of the button

## Content guidelines

- Don't use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.
- Start labels with action verbs. If the button is part of an action dialog, make sure it matches the dialog header.
- Position buttons in consistent places in the interface
- Use the right button for the primary action, if the button group is right-aligned
- Use the left button for the primary action, if the button group is left- or center-aligned
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion when having to decide
- For buttons that are used to cancel destructive actions: label them "Never mind" or similar, instead of cancel. It makes things much easier for users to understand.
- UI usage - Button labels should be no longer than 3 words
- Webpage usage - Button labels should be no longer than 5 words

## Accessibility

- When Button is focused, both the Space and Enter keys will activate the button.
- All Button variants are checked in terms of color contrast and passed all the requirements.
- Buttons have a focus state when using keyboard navigation.
