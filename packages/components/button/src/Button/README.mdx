Start actions, such as “Add”, “Cancel” or “Save”.

Avoid using buttons as links. Use [Textlink](/components/text-link) instead.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-button';
```

## Examples

### Variants

Button has 5 different variants:

- **Primary** - Used for the most important actions in any scenario. Don’t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Secondary** - Used for secondary actions, the most commonly used button type.
- **Positive** - For use when the action has a positive connotation such as creating or publishing a new entity.
- **Negative** - For destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.
- **Transparent** - For having an unstyled button. Use this only on light backgrounds.

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonVariantsExample.tsx

```

### Sizes

Button has 3 different sizes:

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonSizesExample.tsx

```

### States

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonStatesExample.tsx

```

### Full width

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonFullWidthExample.tsx

```

### Rendered as `a` tag

By default, button is rendered as a `button` tag. But you can change it to `a` tag, by providing `as` prop. Don't forget to pass `href` prop as well.

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonAsAExample.tsx

```

### With icons

You can add an icon by providing the following props:

- `startIcon` - adds icon to the left side of the button
- `endIcon` - adds icon to the right side of the button

The `variant` prop of the icon is automatically adjusted based on the `variant` of the button. If you are using a button with `variant="transparent"` you can also set the icon variant manually.

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonWithIconExample.tsx

```

## Content guidelines

- Don't use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.
- Start labels with action verbs. If the button is part of an action dialog, make sure it matches the dialog header.
- Position buttons in consistent places in the interface
- Use the right button for the primary action, if the button group is right-aligned
- Use the left button for the primary action, if the button group is left- or center-aligned
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion when having to decide
- For buttons that are used to cancel destructive actions: label them "Never mind" or similar, instead of cancel. It makes things much easier for users to understand.
- UI usage - Button labels should be no longer than 3 words
- Webpage usage - Button labels should be no longer than 5 words

## Accessibility

- When Button is focused, both the Space and Enter keys will activate the button.
- All Button variants are checked in terms of color contrast and passed all the requirements.
- Buttons have a focus state when using keyboard navigation.
