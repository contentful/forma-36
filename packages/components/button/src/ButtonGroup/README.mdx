`ButtonGroup` should be used to group buttons whose actions are related, with an option to merge them together or split them with an equal amount of free space.

## Import

```js static=true
import { ButtonGroup } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

### Merged

One of the common use cases is to merge primary button with a secondary button or with a button that opens a dropdown with secondary actions.

Also, it is possible to add a divider for buttons that don't have borders (`primary`, `positive`, and `negative` variants).

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonGroupMergedExample.tsx

```

### Spaced

Instead of merging buttons all together you can use `variant="spaced"` to make them spaced and control an empty space with `spacing` property.

```jsx file=../../examples/ButtonGroupSpacedExample.tsx

```

## Accessibility

If using a button that won't have text be sure to provide an `aria-label` property.

## Props (API reference)

  of="ButtonGroup"
