`IconButton` composes the [Button](../components/button) component except that it renders only an icon.

## Import

```js static=true
import { IconButton } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

### Sizes and Variations

You need to pass an [Icon component](../components/icon) you want to render to the `icon` prop, you may also provide `variant` and `size` to the icon.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonExample.tsx

```

### As toolbar actions

Usually `IconButton` should be used in a toolbars, action bars and in all other space restricted containers where rendering `Button` is not possible.

We suggest to use [Tooltip](../components/tooltip) as a wrapper of `IconButton` to help user with understanding button's purpose.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonToolbarExample.tsx

```

## Accessibility

We enforce `aria-label` property for `IconButton` component to ensure that these buttons are fully accessible for screen readers.

## Props (API reference)

<Props
  of="IconButton"
  storybookPath="/story/components-button-iconbutton--basic"
/>
