It represents a simple, familiar action that uses only an icon.

Only use icon buttons with universally recognized icons that users are likely familiar with from other products or contexts. Icon buttons are best suited for simple, frequently used, or contextually clear actions, such as closing a window or deleting an item. Use them when screen space is limited or complementing a more prominent interface action.

## Import

```js static=true
import { IconButton } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { IconButton } from '@contentful/f36-button';
```

## Examples

Variants, sizes, and states match those of the [Button](./button) component.

### Variations

- **Primary** - For the most important actions in a scenario. While icon buttons can technically be styled as primary, they’re not recommended for primary actions due to their limited clarity compared to labeled buttons.
- **Secondary** - For secondary actions, the most commonly used button type.
- **Positive** - When the action has a positive connotation.
- **Negative** - For destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.
- **Transparent** - For having an unstyled button. Use this only on light backgrounds.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonVariationsExample.tsx

```

### Sizes

The button has 3 different sizes:

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonSizesExample.tsx

```

### Tooltip

A built-in [Tooltip](./tooltip) is available to provide users with additional context about the purpose when they hover over the button.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonTooltipExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="IconButton" />

## Accessibility

The IconButton component requires an `aria-label` to ensure full accessibility for screen readers.

For easier understanding, use tooltipProps and set its content to match the `aria-label`. It’s recommended to ensure tooltipProps and `aria-label` have the same content.
