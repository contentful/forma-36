Start actions, such as "Lock" or "Delete".

The button meaning is only represented with an icon. Use it only with icons users are familiar with from previous experience in other products.

## Import

```js static=true
import { IconButton } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { IconButton } from '@contentful/f36-button';
```

## Examples

### Sizes and Variations

You need to pass an [Icon component](../components/icon) you want to render to the `icon` prop, you may also provide `variant` and `size` to the icon.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonExample.tsx

```

### As toolbar actions

In toolbars, action bars, and in all other space restricted containers we suggest using `IconButton` instead of `Button` component.

For these cases, it would be also beneficial to use [Tooltip](../components/tooltip) as a wrapper of `IconButton` to help users with understanding the button's purpose.

```jsx file=../../examples/IconButtonToolbarExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="IconButton" />

## Accessibility

We enforce `aria-label` property for `IconButton` component to ensure that these buttons are fully accessible for screen readers.
