Popover is used to display some content on top of another, and should be paired with a clickable trigger element.
It is a base for other more specific component, like `Menu`, `Autocomplete` and `Multiselect`. Please, consider using these specific componenets to cover your needs.

## How to use Popover

- If `Menu`, `Autocomplete` and `Multiselect` components are not covering your use cases, only then you can use `Popover`.
- Double check with designers before using this component. Probably you can just use one of the more specific components, like `Menu`, `Autocomplete` and `Multiselect`
- Keep in mind that everything related to accessibility for the popover content you have to develop on your own.

## Code examples

- Pass trigger component as a child for `PopoverTrigger`.
- Pass popover content as a child for `PopoverContent`

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <TextLink variant="primary">Text link</TextLink>
</React.Fragment>
```

### TextLink with icon (`icon`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <TextLink icon={<ExternalLink />}>Primary</TextLink>
  <br />
  <TextLink icon={<ExternalLink />} alignIcon="end">
    Primary
  </TextLink>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Content recommendations

- Use an interactive element such as `button` for `PopoverTrigger`

## Accessibility

- When the popover is opened, focus is moved to the `PopoverContent`. If you set `autoFocus`to `false`, it will not move the focus.
- When the popover is open and focus is within the `PopoverContent`, click on `Esc` key will close the popover. If you set `closeOnEsc` to `false`, it will not close.
- When the popover is open and focus is within the `PopoverContent`, click outside popover or blurring out will close the it. If you set `closeOnBlur` to `false`, it will not close.
- All the necessery a11y attributes for `PopoverContent` and `PopoverTrigger` are provided.
