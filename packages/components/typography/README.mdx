# @contentful/f36-typography

Forma 36 includes a number of typography components, including a wrapper to automatically add spacing to typography elements.

Typography components are not tied to specific semantic elements - it's possible to render any typography component as a `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `span`, or `div` element.

Forma 36 uses system UI fonts. System UI fonts refer to the fonts used to render text in the UI of an operating system. When used on the web they offer familiarity, load with zero-latency, and support a wide number of character sets.
