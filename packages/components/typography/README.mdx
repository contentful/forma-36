Forma 36 includes a number of typography components, including a wrapper to automatically add spacing to typography elements.

Typography components are not tied to specific semantic elements - it's possible to render any typography component as a `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `span`, or `div` element.

Forma 36 uses system UI fonts. System UI fonts refer to the fonts used to render text in the UI of an operating system. When used on the web they offer familiarity, load with zero-latency, and support a wide number of character sets.

## Components

### Text

_Text_ is a basic typography component. Basically, it's a span element with a default font family, font color, font size and letter spacing.

```jsx
<Text>I love Forma 36 design system.</Text>
```

You can pass all basic font related parameters as properties of the component.

### Paragraph

_Paragraph_ is essentially as `Text` component rendered as `p` and with default bottom margin applied. It is intended to be used as paragraph copy.

```jsx
<Paragraph>I love Forma 36 design system.</Paragraph>
```

### Heading

_Heading_ is intended to be used to define a section. Headings are very important for accessibility, as it helps to make copy more easily scannable and guides a user through your content.

Another accessibility consideration screen readers. Visually impaired people often use screen readers, which find sections in your copy based on your heading hierarchy.

```jsx
<Heading>I love Forma 36 design system</Heading>
```

### Subheading

_Subheadings_ are intended to be used as headings for copy nested within a section. EX: a subheading under Contact may be Address or Phone number.

```jsx
<Subheading>I love Forma 36 design system</Subheading>
```

### SectionHeading

_Section Heading_ is intended to be used as a title for a widget, and is most commonly used in the sidebar.

```jsx
<SectionHeading>I love Forma 36 design system</SectionHeading>
```

### DisplayText

DisplayText is used to display text in special scenarios - example usages of DisplayText include empty states, promotional/featured items, etc.

DisplayText should **not** be used as a replacement for headings/page titles (use the Heading component instead).

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <DisplayText size="large">I love Forma 36 design system (large)</DisplayText>
  <DisplayText>I love Forma 36 design system</DisplayText>
</React.Fragment>
```
