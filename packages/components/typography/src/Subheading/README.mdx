`Subheading` is intended to be used as a heading for copy nested within a section. For example: a subheading under Contact may be Address or Phone number.

### Import

```js static=true
import { Subheading } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Subheading } from '@contentful/f36-typography';
```

## Examples

### Basic

```jsx file=../../examples/SubheadingExample.tsx

```

### Margins

By default `Subheading` component has a margin bottom of `spacingM` (`1rem`). You can override the default margin bottom by specifying it explicitly on the component level by `marginBottom="none"` or any other value from [our spacing options](/tokens/spacing)

```jsx file=../../examples/SubheadingSpacingExample.tsx

```

### `as` property

By default `Subheading` has an `h3` tag. But you can change it by providing `as` prop with values from `h1` to `h6`.

```jsx file=../../examples/SubheadingTagExample.tsx

```

### Truncated text

Sometimes you might have to truncate the text in the `Subheading` component, so we provide the prop especially for that. Under the hood, what it does is add `overflow: hidden` and set `text-overflow` to `ellipsis`. Have a look at the example below:

```jsx file=../../examples/SubheadingTruncatedExample.tsx

```

### Composition

```jsx file=../../examples/SubheadingCompositionExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="Subheading" />

## Density support

This component supports multiple densities thanks to the [useDensity](/hooks/use-density) hook and automatically adjusts its styling for each density (when wrapped with the `DensityProvider`).
