`SectionHeading` is intended to be used as a title for each section. SectionHeading are very important for accessibility, as they help to make copy more easily scannable and guides a user through your content. When using screen readers, it finds sections in your copy based on your heading hierarchy.

### Import

```js static=true
import { SectionHeading } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { SectionHeading } from '@contentful/f36-typography';
```

## Examples

### Basic

```jsx file=../../examples/SectionHeadingExample.tsx

```

### Margins

By default `SectionHeading` component has a margin bottom of `spacingL` (`1.5rem`). You can override the default margin bottom by specifying it explicitly on the component level by `marginBottom="none"` or any other value from [our spacing options](/tokens/spacing)

```jsx file=../../examples/SectionHeadingSpacingExample.tsx

```

### `as` property

By default `SectionHeading` has an `h2` tag. But you can change it by providing `as` prop with values from `h1` to `h6`.

```jsx file=../../examples/SectionHeadingTagExample.tsx

```

### Truncated text

Sometimes you might have to truncate the text in the `SectionHeading` component, so we provide the prop especially for that. Under the hood, what it does is add `overflow: hidden` and set `text-overflow` to `ellipsis`. Have a look at the example below:

```jsx file=../../examples/SectionHeadingTruncatedExample.tsx

```

### Composition

```jsx file=../../examples/SectionHeadingCompositionExample.tsx

```

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="SectionHeading" />

## Density support

This component supports multiple densities thanks to the [useDensity](/hooks/use-density) hook and automatically adjusts its styling for each density (when wrapped with the `DensityProvider`).
