`Heading` is intended to be used to define the title of the page. They are displayed as `h1` by default. Accessibility requires having just one `h1` tag on the page. Keep that in mind during the implementation.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Heading } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

```jsx file=../examples/HeadingExample.tsx

```

### Margins

Forma 36 typography components provide a way to set their own margins. By default `Heading` component has a margin bottom of `1rem` (`16px`). You can override the default margin bottom by specifying it explicitly on the component level by `marginBottom="none"` or any other value from [our spacing options](/tokens/spacing)

```jsx file=../examples/HeadingSpacingExample.tsx

```

### `as` property

For some cases, you might have to use `Heading` in a different context than the page title. For that we provide you with `as` property, to allow you to set the tag of the component to another tag than `h1`

```jsx file=../examples/HeadingTagExample.tsx

```

### Truncated text

Sometimes you might have to truncate the text in the `Heading` component, so we provide the prop especially for that. Under the hood, what it does is add `overflow: hidden` and set `text-overflow` to `ellipsis`. Have a look at the example below:

```jsx file=../examples/HeadingTruncatedExample.tsx

```
