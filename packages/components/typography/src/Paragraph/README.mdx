`Paragraph` component is rendered as `<p>` and with default bottom margin of `spacingM` (`1rem`) applied. It is one of the most commonly used typography components.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Paragraph } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Paragraph } from '@contentful/f36-typography';
```

## Examples

### Basic

```jsx file=../../examples/ParagraphExample.tsx

```

### Margins

By default `Paragraph` component has a margin bottom of `spacingM` (`1rem`). You can override the default margin bottom by specifying it explicitly on the component level by `marginBottom="none"` or any other value from [our spacing options](/tokens/spacing)

```jsx file=../../examples/ParagraphSpacingExample.tsx

```

### Truncated text

Sometimes you might have to truncate the text in the `Paragraph` component, so we provide the prop especially for that. Under the hood, what it does is add `overflow: hidden` and set `text-overflow` to `ellipsis`. Have a look at the example below:

```jsx file=../../examples/ParagraphTruncatedExample.tsx

```
