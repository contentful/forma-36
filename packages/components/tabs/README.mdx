Tabs is a component that makes navigating between sections of related content possible, displaying one section at a time.

Use Tabs if the content can be separated into sections that make sense as standalone pieces of information.
Be aware that the users will not see all the content at the same time. Make sure the first section is the most relevant one.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { Tabs } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Tabs } from '@contentful/f36-tabs';
```

## Examples

### Basic

```jsx file=examples/TabsBasicExample.tsx

```

### With divider

By default, `Tabs` has no divider, but you can add it by providing `variant` prop to the `Tabs.List`

With vertical divider:

```jsx file=examples/TabsWithVerticalDividerExample.tsx

```

With horizontal divider:

```jsx file=examples/TabsWithHorizontalDividerExample.tsx

```

### With default open tab

```jsx file=examples/TabsWithDefaultTabExample.tsx

```

### With disabled tab

```jsx file=examples/TabsWithDisabledTabExample.tsx

```

### Controlled Tabs

By default, `Tabs` is an uncontrolled component, but you can make it controlled by providing `currentTab` and `onTabChange` props.

```jsx file=examples/TabsControlledExample.tsx

```

### Controlled Tabs with always mounted Tabs.Panel

By default, `Tabs.Panel` is unmounted, if it's not an active tab. But you can make it always mounted by passing the `forceMount` prop.
Keep in mind that you have to provide additional styles to hide not active `Tabs.Panel`.

```jsx file=examples/TabsControlledWithMountedContentExample.tsx

```

<PropsTable of="Tabs" />

## Content guidelines

- every `Tab` should have concise copy
- all content within a Tab should be related to it's label
- to ensure an optimal cognitive load for users, do not use more than six (6) Tabs at any given time
