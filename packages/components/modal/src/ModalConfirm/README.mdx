`ModalConfirm` is a convenience wrapper on top of [Modal]. It is intended to use for showing confirmation dialogs.

## Import

```js static=true
import { ModalConfirm } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { ModalConfirm } from '@contentful/f36-modal';
```

## Examples

### Basic

`ModalConfirm` has 3 different intents: `positive`, `primary` and `negative`. Changing this property changes the variant of the primary button.

Here is an example of a modal with a positive intent:

```jsx file=../../examples/ModalConfirmBasicExample.tsx

```

### Changing button labels

You can change action button labels by using `cancelLabel` and `confirmLabel`.

```jsx file=../../examples/ModalConfirmPromptExample.tsx

```

### Changing sizes

There are 4 different sizes for modals: `small`, `medium`, `large`, `fullWidth`. Pick a size based on the amount of content you have to present in them.

`ModalConfirm` behavior is exacly the same as [Modal]. Please, refer to [Modal] documentation for code example.

### Using ModalLauncher

When you want to open a modal from a function (outside of React component code), use [ModalLauncher.](../components/modal-launcher)

## Props (API reference)

<PropsTable of="ModalConfirm" />

## Content guidelines

Please, refer to [Modal] documentation.

## Accessibility

- When the modal opens, focus is trapped within it.
- When the modal opens, focus is automatically set to the `Cancel` button, or the element from `initialFocusRef`.
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the modal activated.
- By default, clicking on the overlay closes the modal.
- By default, pressing `Esc` closes the modal.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the modal.
