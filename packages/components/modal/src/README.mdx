`Modal` appears on top of the main content and moves the system into a special mode requiring user interaction. It blocks interaction with the main content until an action is taken.

Modal dialogs are often triggered by an action a user took, and should be used to inform, confirm or complete a task. Content behind a modal dialog is inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Modal } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Modal } from '@contentful/f36-modal';
```

## Examples

Use `Modal`:

- to request information critical for a user to continue their current process
- to warn users about a potentially destructive action they are taking

Don't use `Modal`:

- for nonessential information that is not related to the current user flow
- for interrupting high-stake processes such as checkout flows

### Basic

```jsx file=../examples/ModalBasicExample.tsx

```

### Modal with Form

```jsx file=../examples/ModalWithFormExample.tsx

```

### Modal with child component in Header

```jsx file=../examples/ModalWithChildComponentInHeaderExample.tsx

```

### Changing sizes

There are 4 different sizes for modals: `small`, `medium`, `large`, `fullWidth`, and `fullscreen`. Pick a size based on the amount of content you have to present in them.

You can also pass an arbitary width in pixels, but we recommend to choose of the predefined values.

```jsx file=../examples/ModalSizesExample.tsx

```

#### Choosing a fullWidth modal

As a rule of thumb, `fullWidth` modals shouldn’t be used frequently. Use them modals specially to present imagery or when you need to present a layout with columns in it. Never use `fullWidth` modals for a single column layout as the length of the line will affect readability.

### Setting initial focus

When the modal opens, focus is automatically set to the close button, but you have the possibility to set an initial focus to a specific element of your modal dialog.

Either by using the `initialFocusRef` prop:

```jsx file=../examples/ModalInitialFocusRefExample.tsx

```

... or by setting the `autoFocus` attribute to an interactive element, such as an `input` or `button`:

```jsx file=../examples/ModalAutoFocusExample.tsx

```

### Using Modal.Controls

Using `Modal.Controls` is optional and you may have a modal without control buttons. When you have control buttons, follow the following rules:

- always use `Button` component with `size="small"`
- your primary action button should be aligned to the right
- there should be only one primary action
- ideally, 1 secondary button should be enough when paired with a primary one. It’s allowed, however, to add a second one for another action.

### Using ModalLauncher

When you want to open a modal from a function (outside of React component code), use [ModalLauncher.](../components/modal-launcher)

## Props (API reference)

## Content guidelines

For general guidelines around content and how to better write copy, consult this [UX writing page](/guidelines/ux-writing-principles) . Find below a few suggestions on how to elaborate good content for modals:

#### Titles

Make them brief and easily inteligible, following this structure: **verb + noun**

✅ Do:

- Create content type
- Delete entry?
- Add to release

❌ Don't:

- Do you want to add this page to your release?
- Permanently delete this entry?
- Are you sure you want to delete this entry?

#### Body

The body is the main content of a modal. Therefore, try not to get chatty and keep it to the information that is necessary for users to accomplish their tasks. For more guidance on how to write good content for a modal, refer to [this UX writing document](/guidelines/ux-writing-principles).

#### Buttons label

A good way to think about buttons labels is to mentalize what users will be thinking when pressing the button. Actions should be clear and have a **verb + noun** structure that describes the action.

Buttons in modals should be short and sweet and shouldn’t require a lot of effort from users to understand what’s going to happen.

As a rule of thumb, users shouldn’t feel unclear of the outcomes of clicking on a specific button.

✅ Do: `Add field`, `Remove page`, `Create content type`, `Add page to release`

❌ Don't: `Discard`, `New page`, `New content type`, `Go`, `Add`

Avoid vague actions such as `Remove` (without saying what’s going to be removed) or `Add`.

Another scenario to avoid is to create lengthy buttons and with more that one action being described.

## Accessibility

- When the modal opens, focus is trapped within it.
- When the modal opens, focus is automatically set to the close button, or the element from `initialFocusRef`.
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the modal activated.
- By default, clicking on the overlay closes the modal.
- By default, pressing `Esc` closes the modal.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the modal.
