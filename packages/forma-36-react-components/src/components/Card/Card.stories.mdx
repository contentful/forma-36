# Card

[source code](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/master/packages/forma-36-react-components/src/components/Card/Card.tsx)

A Card is a component to group information or content of a particular subject in one place.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="default"
    args={{ title: 'Title', content: 'This is the Card’s content' }}
  >
    {({ title, content, ...args }) => (
      <Card {...args}>
        <Typography>
          <Heading>{title}</Heading>
          <Paragraph>{content}</Paragraph>
        </Typography>
      </Card>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage

Here you will find the most common ways of using the Card component.

### With `onClick`

It’s possible to call an action when the user clicks on the Card. To do that, you only need to pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with onClick">
    {(args) => {
      const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
      return (
        <div>
          <Card
            {...args}
            onClick={() => setShow(!show)}
            style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}
          >
            Click on this card
            <br />
            {show && (
              <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
                ✨✨✨
              </span>
            )}
          </Card>
        </div>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### With `link` and `target`

A Card can be used with the pourpose to navigate a user to an external page. To do that a user must pass a value to the `href` prop.
Optionally, the user can pass a `target` prop to control how the link should be open.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with link and target"
    args={{ href: 'http://f36.contentful.com', target: '_blank' }}
  >
    {(args) => (
      <Card {...args}>
        <Typography>
          <Heading>Forma36</Heading>
          <Paragraph>
            Forma 36 is an open-source design system by Contentful created with
            the intent to reduce the overhead of creating UI by providing tools
            and guidance for digital teams building and extending Contentful
            products.
          </Paragraph>
        </Typography>
      </Card>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
