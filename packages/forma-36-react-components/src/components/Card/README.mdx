## Examples of usage

Here you will find the most common ways of using the Card component.

### With `onClick`

It‚Äôs possible to call an action when the user clicks on the Card. To do that, you only need to pass a function to the `onClick` prop.

```jsx
const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

<Card onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
  Click on this card
  <br />
  {show && (
    <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
      ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
    </span>
  )}
</Card>;
```

### Selectable cards

Sometimes you will need to use the Card as an selectable element in the UI. To achieve that behaviour,
you should use a combination of the `onClick` and `selected` props. The former controlling the latter.

```jsx
const [taco, setTaco] = useState(false);
const [pizza, setPizza] = useState(false);
const [broccoli, setBroccoli] = useState(false);

<div>
  <Heading>What is your favorite food?</Heading>
  <div>
    <Card onClick={() => setTaco(!taco)} selected={taco}>
      <span role="img" aria-label="taco">
        üåÆ
      </span>
    </Card>
    <Card onClick={() => setPizza(!pizza)} selected={pizza}>
      <span role="img" aria-label="pizza">
        üçï
      </span>
    </Card>
    <Card onClick={() => setBroccoli(!broccoli)} selected={broccoli}>
      <span role="img" aria-label="broccoli">
        ü•¶
      </span>
    </Card>
  </div>
</div>;
```

### With `link` and `target`

A Card can be used with the pourpose to navigate a user to an external page. To do that a user must pass a value to the `href` prop.
Optionally, the user can pass a `target` prop to control how the link should be open.

```jsx
<Card href="http://f36.contentful.com" target="_blank">
  <Typography>
    <Paragraph>
      Forma 36 is an open-source design system by Contentful created with the
      intent to reduce the overhead of creating UI by providing tools and
      guidance for digital teams building and extending Contentful products.
    </Paragraph>
  </Typography>
</Card>
```
