Switch is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Switch works like a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off, like a light switch.

## How to use Switch

- use when a setting requires an on/off or show/hide function to display the results
- use when user needs to perform instantaneous actions that do not need a review or confirmation
- use when user is toggling independent features or behaviors

### Switch vs Checkbox

Switch is a two-step action: selection and execution, whereas checkbox is just selection of an option and its execution usually requires another control.

## Code examples

```jsx
<Switch id="testSwitch" labelText="label for switch" />
```

### Switch disabled

```jsx
<Switch id="testSwitch" labelText="label for switch" isDisabled />
```

## Accessibility

- use clear and concise label for Switch component
- if needed provide additional information for the user if Switch will cause a change in the context
