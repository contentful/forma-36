RadioButton is a form element that gives users the possibility to select only one option from a number of choices.
This is a stripped down version for custom made solutions - please consider using [RadioButtonField component](https://f36.contentful.com/components/radio-button-field/) for full-fledged `<input type='radio'>` experience.
