## How to use RadioButton

- RadioButton
  We're using native radio buttons (the mockup just acts as an example).
  There are 2 ways to display the labels:

- Grouping a set of options with a label (medium weight). The labels for the individual radio buttons are displayed in regular weight to maintain the hierarchy.
- Omitting the overarching label. The labels for the individual radio buttons are displayed in medium weight.
