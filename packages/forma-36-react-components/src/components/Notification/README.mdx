Notifications give immediate feedback about an action triggered or experienced by an user. They will dismiss after 6 seconds, or after being clicked.

## How to use Notifiaction

- Consider where the notification will be placed and which variation is most appropriate
- Don't confuse notifications with notes, which persist in the UI and do not dismiss

## Code examples

### Basic example

```jsx
<Button
  buttonType="muted"
  onClick={() => Notification.success('An example notification')}
>
  Show notification
</Button>
```

The `Notification` component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is a guide to when to use certain variations.

### Intent

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button
    buttonType="positive"
    onClick={() => Notification.success('This is a success notification')}
  >
    Show success notification
  </Button>
  <Button
    buttonType="negative"
    onClick={() => Notification.error('This is an error notification')}
  >
    Show error notification
  </Button>
  <Button
    buttonType="warning"
    onClick={() => Notification.warning('This is a warning notification')}
  >
    Show warning notification
  </Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

### Position

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button
    buttonType="muted"
    onClick={() => {
      Notification.setPosition('top');
      Notification.success('Notification message at top');
    }}
  >
    Show notification at top of viewport
  </Button>
  <Button
    buttonType="muted"
    onClick={() => {
      Notification.setPosition('bottom');
      Notification.success('Notification message at bottom');
    }}
  >
    Show notification at bottom of viewport
  </Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Content recommendations

- Use clear and succinct copy, since the notification will only be available for 6 seconds
- Use active voice, present tense, and consider tone of voice depending on the circumstance
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)
