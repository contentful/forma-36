# Spinner

A Spinner is a graphic element that helps communicating to users that an action is in progress and it will take some time to be completed.

```jsx
<Spinner />
```

## Examples of usage

### With text

It’s possible to use the Spinner with other elements. A very common pattern is using it together with text.

```jsx
<div>
  Loading <Spinner />
</div>
```

Another good example of the Spinner being used with other components is the loading state of [Forma36’s button](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-react-components/src/components/Button).
