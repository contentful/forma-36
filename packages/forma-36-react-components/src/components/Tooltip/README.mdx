Tooltips are very useful to communicate extra information related to an element on the screen.

## Best practices

- Use short and clear messages as the Tooltipâ€™s content
- Even though it's possible to pass any ReactNode as a content of the Tooltip,
  we do not recommend passing very complex components try to use only [Phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content)
