## How to use Portal

Anything that you put inside the Portal component renders in a `<div data-cf-ui-portal>` element that gets appended to `document.body` by default. You can append to a different container by passing the HTML element of the container as the `container` prop.

## Code examples

```jsx
// import { Portal } from '@contenful/forma-36-react-components';

<Portal>Render in a new tree.</Portal>
```
