Notes provide context and information about a situation or action. Notes draw the users attention to a circumstance relevant to an action they're performing or a screen they're accessing. Don't confuse notes with notifications, which appear as feedback after a user has performed an action.

## How to use Note

- Use an adequate note type to communicate the right kind of information
- Place the note visually closer to the action or real estate it relates to
- Unlike notifications, notes don't show up as feedback only after a user has performed an action

## Component variations

Give couple of clear examples of the usage of the components, that includes import

## Code examples

The Note component can be configured in a number of different ways. Learn when to use certain variations with this guide.

### Basic example

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>
    Information that is relevant to the context the user is currently in.
  </Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

### Note type (`noteType`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note noteType="positive">Positive</Note>
  <Note noteType="warning">Warning</Note>
  <Note noteType="negative">Negative</Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

### Note with title (`title`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note title="Primary title">Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note title="Positive title" noteType="positive">
    Positive
  </Note>
  <Note title="Warning title" noteType="warning">
    Warning
  </Note>
  <Note title="Negative title" noteType="negative">
    Negative
  </Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Content recommendations

- Use clear and succinct copy
- Ensure the copy is easily scannable. Focus on the objective and limit the number of concepts in each sentence
- Use progressive disclosure. Eliminate details that can be revealed as the user interacts and requires more information
- Use active voice, present tense, and consider tone of voice depending on the circumstance
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
