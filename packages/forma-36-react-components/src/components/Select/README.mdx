Select allows users to make a single selection from an options menu.
We provide also [SelectField](https://f36.contentful.com/components/select-field/) component, that contains Label and hint or error message. Keep in mind that Select should not be used without the label, we recommend to use `SelectField` that will provide the label for you.

## How to use Select

- Use Select to present many different options in a compact unit. When you have only a few options present them all at once, using [radio buttons](https://f36.contentful.com/components/radio-button/).
- Select usually are used in forms
- Order the list of options in a logical way, so it make sense for user
- Don't use Select for very long list of options, istead for those cases use [Autocomplete](https://f36.contentful.com/components/autocomplete/)

### Select vs dropdown

Dropdown menus are typically used for navigation or command menus, where an action is initiated based on the selection.
Select is a type of input, where user is choosing one option from the list, typically used in Forms.

## Code examples

```jsx
<>
  <Select id="optionSelect" name="optionSelect" width="large">
    <Option value="optionOne">Option 1</Option>
    <Option value="optionTwo">Long Option 2</Option>
  </Select>
</>
```

## Content recommendations

- Give a short description (1–3 words) of the requested input.
- Be written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase).
- Avoid punctuation and articles (“the”, “an”, “a”).
- Be independent sentences. To support internationalization, they should not act as the first part of a sentence that is finished by the component’s options.
- If the selection needs more explanation, use help text below the field.
- options should be labelled in a clear way, so it's obvious what the option will do

## Accessibility

- select should contain label and if possible hint or validation if it's required. We provide [SelectField](https://f36.contentful.com/components/select-field/) component, that contains all of those necessary elements.
