## How to use TextLinks

- TextLinks are used to display actions that have a lower priority compared to actions that are accessible via a button. 
- They should also be used when linking to URLs, and are preferred over using buttons when used for this purpose.
- Use clear, succinct, and accurate labels
- Start TextLink labels with verbs, for example "Add field", not "New field"
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion when having to decide


## Component variations
There are a number of variations of TextLink styles, here is a guide for when to use them:

- **Primary** - Used for primary actions, or the default for links to URLs.
- **Positive** - Used for a positive actions, such as creating or publishing a new entity.
- **Negative** - Used for destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.
- **Secondary** - For actions that should be emphasized less than the default primary style.
- **Muted** - For actions that should be emphasized less than the secondary style.
- **White** - For actions appearing on a dark background.
