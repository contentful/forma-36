CheckboxField is a component that gives an possiblity to easy setup proper checkbox with it's label. Component contains options for set also helper text if needed that would be displayed below the label.

Provide the overview of the components variants.

## Example of usage

```jsx
import {CheckboxField} from '@contentful/forma-36-react-components';

<CheckboxField
  checked={}
  onChange={hadnleOnChange}
  name="checkbox name"
  id="randomId"
  labelText="Label text"
  helpText="Helper text displayed below"
/>
```

## Content recommendations

 - Start every option from a capital letter
 - Do not use commas at the end of each line
 - If the checkbox is used to agree to terms and conditions, we recommend to use first person in the sentence

## Best practices

 - Checkboxes should work independently, checking one should not affect any other checkbox. 
 - Checkbox should always have a label if it's used for toggling
 - Listing options for a user should have some order, some sort of system is most likely expected by the user when working with lists (numerical, time based)
 
## Accessibility

If possible, we strongly recommend providing accessibility guidelines.
