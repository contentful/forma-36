## An app shell that structures regions of content and interaction

The workbench assembles the outer app shell which defines regions to structure content and interactions. <br />
It consists of 4 screen regions which have specific requirements for content and interactions.

## Title bar

The title bar provides navigational guidance and primary actions on the current view.

### Content and interaction guidelines

- The Title Bar should only provide actions which are global to the current view (e.g. Button to create a user on a users list view)
- When multiple global actions are needed a dropdown menu should be used
- Buttons that submit a form on the current view should not be placed in the title bar but be part of that specific form.
