## How to use CopyButton

CopyButton can be used in combination with text inputs where the input value should be easy to copy. In such cases it is best to position the CopyButton at the end of the input.

## Component variations

<CopyButton copyValue="Lorem Ipsum" />;

## Code examples

```jsx
import { CopyButton } from '@contentful/forma-36-react-components';

<CopyButton copyValue="Lorem Ipsum" />;
```

An example with a custom tooltip:

```jsx
import { CopyButton } from '@contentful/forma-36-react-components';

<CopyButton
  copyValue="Lorem Ipsum"
  tooltipCopiedText="The text has been copied"
  tooltipText="Copy this text to clipboard"
/>;
```
