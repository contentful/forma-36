- fix(EntityListItem): differentiate click events for entire entity card, and actions menu
- It was previously impossible to differentiate when a user was clicking the menu trigger/menu
- and when they were clicking anywhere else in the entity card, because events that occur in
- the trigger/menu were also bubbling up the to the onclick handler for the entire card.
- This PR also resolves a react validateDOM() warning, because when rendering an action menu,
- we were rendering a button within a button.
- The solution was to create a fragment container with 2 children, the first containing the
- actual entity card elements like thumbnail, title, description etc. and the second
- containing the optional actions menu. That way, click events from either component do not
- clash with eachother.
