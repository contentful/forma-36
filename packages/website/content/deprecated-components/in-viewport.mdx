# InViewport

InViewport component got removed in version 4.

If you need to use InViewport for any situation, we recommend checking out [a react hook](https://github.com/zeusdeux/use-is-in-viewport) that allows using the [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) declaratively in your React app to find out if an element is in a given viewport.
