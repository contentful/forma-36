# Workbench

The `Workbench` component is **deprecated** in version 5 and will be replaced by the `Layout` component. This guide will help you migrate your usage of `Workbench` to the updated `Layout` component.

The Workbench package will no longer receive updates. Please migrate to `Layout` as soon as possible for continued support and improvements.

## Why migrate?

- `Layout` offers a more flexible, modern, and composable API.
- Improved support for responsive design and accessibility.
- Consistent API with other Forma 36 components.

---

## Key Differences

- `Layout` replaces `Workbench` and its compound components (`WorkbenchHeader`, `WorkbenchSidebar`, `WorkbenchContent`).
- The API and prop names may differ.
- `Layout` supports left and right sidebars, header, and content via dedicated props.

## Additional Notes

Layout supports both left and right sidebars. Use `leftSidebar` or `rightSidebar`.
For advanced use cases, refer to the [Layout examples and documentation](/components/layout).
If you used custom props or patterns with Workbench, check the Layout API for equivalent or improved options.
