# Typography

`Typography` component was removed in version 4, for more information, [see the detailed migration guide](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/main/MIGRATION.md#how-to-migrate-your-typography-components).
The main reason for this component was to maintain the spacing between typography components. In version 4 we gave this possibility to each, individual typography component.
Right now instead of wrapping your typography in `Typography` component, you can just set margin value to each individual typography components.

You might have used `Typography` in version 3 like that:

```tsx static=true
<Typography>
  <Heading element="h4" className="className">
    Some text
  </Heading>
</Typography>
```

All you need to do is to use this components directly, without a wrapper:

```tsx static=true
<Heading as="h4" className="className">
  Some text
</Heading>
```
