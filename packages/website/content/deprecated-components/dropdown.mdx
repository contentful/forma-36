# Dropdown

The Dropdown component in version 4 got replaced with three new components:

- [Menu](../components/menu),
- [Autocomplete](../components//autocomplete)
- [Popover](../components/popover).

By creating separate components we improved the accessibility and simplified its API. Each of these new components serves its own purpose.
