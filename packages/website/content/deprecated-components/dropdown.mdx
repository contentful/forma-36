# Dropdown

The Dropdown component in version 4 got replaced with three new components:

- [Menu](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/main/packages/components/menu/README.mdx),
- [Autocomplete](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/main/packages/components/autocomplete/README.mdx)
- [Popover](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/main/packages/components/popover/README.mdx).

By creating separate components we improved the accessibility and simplified its API. Each of these new components serves its own purpose.
