This is the color system we use at Contentful. There are 6 base colors, along with gray and black/white. Each color consists of 9 shades, ranging from `100` to `900`.

## Colors overview

### Semantic

In rare cases, it's handy to use our base semantic colors. They are aliases for the respective `500` shade of each color and hold semantic meaning.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="semantic" />

### Gray

Gray is our main color used for typography, borders and element backgrounds.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="gray" />

### Blue

Blue is our primary color and should be used when you want to highlight a primary action.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="blue" />

### Green

Green is used to highlight positive actions or messages. E.g. when showing a success message, a save action, or a marking a step as complete.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="green" />

### Red

Red is used to highlight negative actions or messages. E.g. when performing
a destructive action such as deleting content, for highlighting validation
or application error messages, or for showing statuses with a negative
context.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="red" />

### Purple

Purple is used sparingly as a generic highlight color. E.g. when highlighting premium value or trials.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="purple" />

### Orange

Orange is used to highlight actions or messages which require attention but
don't necessarily have a negative context. E.g. showing a draft/unpublished
state, or showing a gentle warning message rather than an error message.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="orange" />

### Yellow

Yellow is used very sparingly. Use only when other colors aren't applicable or are already taken in a specific context.

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="yellow" />

### Black

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="black" />

### White

<ColorSwatchGroup colorGroup="white" />

## Accessibility

Black text (anything darker than `gray-800`) is WCAG AA accessible on shades ranging from `100` to `400`, white text is accessible on colors from `500` to `900`.
