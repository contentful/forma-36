import { Heading, Stack, TextLink } from '@contentful/f36-components';
import { ExternalLinkIcon } from '@contentful/f36-icons';
import { Props } from '@contentful/f36-docs-utils';

It’s possible to build forms using Forma 36’s components and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).
In this page we will show a couple of examples on how to do that.

## Import

```jsx static=true
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  Radio,
  Checkbox,
  Select,
  Textarea,
  TextInput,
} from '@contentful/f36-forms';
```

## Examples

### Example of integration with `register()`

```jsx file=examples/RegisterIntegration.tsx

```

### Example of integration with `useController`

First, it's necessary to create a controlled component which will use the `useController` hook and pass its props to the Forma 36 component. Then you use this controlled component in your form:

```jsx file=examples/UseControllerIntegration.tsx

```
