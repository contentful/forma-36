`Grid` is a [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid) based React component, comes with predefined values to ensure design consistency, and ease of use.

The `Grid` consists of two components:

- `Grid`: Used as a container for grid items
- `Grid.Item`: Elements within the Grid

## Import

```js static=true
import { Grid } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Grid vs. Flexbox

The main difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layouts in one dimension - either a row or a column.
Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout rows, and columns.

![One dimensional columns without rows describing the use flexbox, and two dimensional grid describes how the grid works](/docs-images/grid_vs_flexbox.png)

## Examples

### Basic usage

```jsx file=examples/BasicGridExample.tsx

```

### Repeat notation

`repeat()` is a css notation that you can use with the `gridColumns` and `girdRows` properties to make your rules more concise and easier to understand when creating a large amount of columns or rows

**Example:** `gridColumns="1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr"` is same as `gridColumns="repeat(3, 1fr 2fr)"` see below.

```jsx file=examples/RepeatNotationGridExample.tsx

```

### FR unit

Fr is a fractional unit and `1fr` stands for 1 part of the available space. It differs from percentage unit because it distributes available space.

If you place a larger item into a track then the way the fr until will work is to allow that track to take up more space and distribute what is left over.

```jsx file=examples/FrGridExample.tsx

```

### Span keyword

Span keyword works on grid items with the `gridArea` property, use `span` to avoid specifying the end lines for a column or a row.

i.e. instead of specifying `columnStart` and `columnEnd` you can use span to make the grid item take 4 columns

```jsx file=examples/SpanKeywordGridExample.tsx

```

### Content alignment

Just like [Flex] the `Grid` comes with `justifyContent`, `justifyItems`, `alignItems`, `alignContent`, ..etc.

```jsx file=examples/ContentAlignmentGridExample.tsx

```

## Accessibility

According to [WCAG C27](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C27.html) technique, the dom order must match the visual order.

The grid can re-order it's content in various ways through the order css property on grid items, this changes the visual order but the dom order stays the same, hence,
keyboard navigation and focus order maybe affected.

Set the correct order of the elements with `tabindex` attribute to avoid accessibility issues.
