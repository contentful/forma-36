`Stack` is a layout component that makes it easy to stack elements together and apply a space between them.

Basically, `Stack` wraps [Flex](/components/flex) component and allows you to create vertical and horizontal stacks without specifying `alignItems` and `justifyContent` properties.

Also, `Stack` components inherits behaviour of [Box](/components/box) component and allows to pass margins and paddings that are based on our [spacing system](/tokens/spacing).

## Import

```js static=true
import { Stack } from '@contentful/f36-components';
// or
import { Stack } from '@contentful/f36-core';
```

## Examples

You can change the defaults by using `spacing` and `flexDirection` correspondingly.

### Horizontal Stack

By default, `spacing` between all `Stack` children equals our `spacingM` token.
The default direction is `row`, so `Stack` layouts its children horizontally.

```jsx file=examples/HorizontalStackExample.tsx

```

### Vertical Stack

By changing `flexDirection` property to `column`, we make `Stack` component to layout its children vertically.
In this example you can also find an adjusted spacing between children by using `spacing` property.

```jsx file=examples/VerticalStackExample.tsx

```
