`Flex` component is a [Box] with `display: flex` and abilities to apply other flexbox CSS properties via properties of the component.

The `Flex` component is useful because it helps with several common cases:

- Create a one direction layout (vertical or horizontal) with uses Forma 36 [spacing system].
- Compose new component and allow to override element using the `as` property.

## Import

```js static=true
import { Flex } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```

## Examples

### Margins & Paddings

`Flex` component inherits behaviour of [Box] component and allows to pass margins and paddings that are based on our [spacing system].

To control the behaviour of the Flex component you can use specific properties that match [all main Flexbox related CSS attributes](https://cssreference.io/flexbox/).

```jsx file=examples/FlexExample.tsx

```

### Nesting

This example shows how you can nest flexboxes to create more complicated layouts. It also uses the `flexGrow` prop on one of the children to expand it to fill the repaining space.

```jsx file=examples/FlexNestingExample.tsx

```

### Alignment

The `alignItems` prop can be used to align items along the cross axis. When direction is `column`, this refers to horizontal alignment, and when direction is `row` it refers to vertical alignment.

This example horizontally centers items in a vertical stack.

```jsx file=examples/FlexAlignmentExample.tsx

```

### Justification

The `justifyContent` prop can be used to align items along the main axis. When direction is `column`, this refers to vertical alignment, and when direction is `row` it refers to horizontal alignment.

This example vertically centers the stack of items within the available space defined by a container.

```jsx file=examples/FlexJustificationExample.tsx

```

### Using `Flex` to align other Forma components

```jsx file=examples/FlexRealWorldExample.tsx
