## Installation

### Install components

Inside your React project directory, install Forma 36 by running either of the following:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-components
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-components`
```

#### Installing components as separate packages

ou can install Forma 36 React components as separate packages if that's what you need for your project. For example, here's how to install just the button:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-button
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-button`
```

The above option is available, but our recommendation is to use the `@contentful/f36-components` package. Tree shaking will make your bundle contain only components that you actually import and need.

### Install icons

Forma 36 icons are a separate package to reduce the size of the main bundle. If you need to use icons in your project, install them separatly by running either of the following:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-icons
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-icons`
```

#### Additional learning

Forma 36 components are build using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) 📚

## How to use Forma 36

As soon as you have `@contentful/f36-components` added to your project, you can go ahead and start using them in your app. For example you might need a [button](./components/button):

```tsx static=true
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-components';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Button variant="primary">Your button</Button>
  </>
);
```

## How to use GlobalStyles

Control default browser styles with the `GlobalStyles` component. The GlobalStyles component uses the Global component from [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/globals) under the hood. Import GlobalStyles somewhere at the beginning of your project like in the example below:

```jsx static=true
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GlobalStyles } from '@contentful/f36-components';

import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.render(
  <>
    <GlobalStyles />
    <App />
  </>,
  rootElement,
);
```

## Building Contentful apps using Forma 36

Apps are packages that simplify customization and integration by modifying your space in Contentful. An app can help adapt Contentful to individual business processes and integrate with other services.

From small field editor improvements to deeply integrated full-page applications, Forma 36 is here to help you efficiently build apps with the [Contentful App Framework](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/).
