## Setup

### Install Forma 36 components in the React app

Inside your React project directory, install Forma 36 by running either of the following:

When using NPM:

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-components
```

When using YARN:

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-components`
```

### Install Forma 36 icons in the React app

We decided to make a separate package out of icons and this way we make sure that the main bundle will stay small. If you need icons you would need to install a separate package to use tham. Inside your React project directory, install Forma 36 by running either of the following:

When using NPM:

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-icons
```

When using YARN:

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-icons`
```

#### Installing Forma 36 components as separate packages

We provide also an option to install separate packages if that's something that you need for your project. For example, you can install just button package:

When using NPM:

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-button
```

When using YARN:

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-button`
```

The above option is available, but our recommendation is to use the `@contentful/f36-components` package. Three shakings will make your bundle contain only components that you actually import and need.

## How to use Forma 36

As soon as you have `@contentful/f36-components` added to your project, you can go ahead and start using them in your app. For example you might need a [button](./components/button):

```tsx static=true
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-components';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Button variant="primary">Your button</Button>
  </>
);
```

## How to use GlobalStyles

In order to control browser default styles, we provide GlobalStyles component. `GlobalStyles` component is using `Global` components from emotion under the hood.
All you need to do is to add `GlobalStyles` component somewhere at the beginning of your project, have a look at the example:

```jsx static=true
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GlobalStyles } from '@contentful/f36-components';

import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.render(
  <>
    <GlobalStyles />
    <App />
  </>,
  rootElement,
);
```
