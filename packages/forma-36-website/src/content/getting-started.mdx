## Installation

### Install components

Inside your React project directory, install Forma 36 by running the following commands:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-components
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-components
```

When you install `@contentful/f36-components` package, tree shaking will make your bundle contain only components that you actually import and need.

#### Installing components as separate packages

Although we recommend using `@contentful/f36-components`, you can install Forma 36 React components as separate packages if that's what you need for your project. For example, here's how to install just the button:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-button
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-button
```

### Install icons

Forma 36 icons are a separate package to reduce the size of the main bundle. If you need to use icons in your project, install them separately by running either of the following:

**When using NPM:**

```bash static=true
npm i @contentful/f36-icons
```

**When using Yarn:**

```bash static=true
yarn add @contentful/f36-icons
```

#### Additional learning

Forma 36 components are build using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) ðŸ“š

## Using Forma 36

As soon as you have `@contentful/f36-components` added to your project, you can go ahead and start using them in your app. For example, here's how to use a [button](./components/button):

```tsx static=true
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@contentful/f36-components';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Button variant="primary">Your button</Button>
  </>
);
```

## Using GlobalStyles

Control default browser styles with the [GlobalStyles](/components/globalstyles) component. The GlobalStyles component uses the Global component from [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/globals) under the hood. Import GlobalStyles somewhere at the beginning of your project like in the example below:

```jsx static=true
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GlobalStyles } from '@contentful/f36-components';

import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.render(
  <>
    <GlobalStyles />
    <App />
  </>,
  rootElement,
);
```
