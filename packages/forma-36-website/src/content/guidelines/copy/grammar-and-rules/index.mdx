## Tense

Present tense should also be used to describe product behavior. Avoid using the future tense to imply that actions should be done at a later time.

Past tense should also be avoided unless necessary to the context.

## Contractions

To make a sentence more scannable, use contractions when possible. Note that in some cases the words can have more emphasis when they are not contracted (Cannot has greater emphasis than Can't).
