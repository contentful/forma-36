# Capitalization

## Use sentence style caps

Sentence style caps, in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized, should be used across all Contentful products.

This makes sentences a bit more scannable and our UX copy more approachable.

Places where you should use sentence style caps include labels, headings, titles, buttons, and menu items.

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>View your website live</Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>View Your Website Live</Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
/>

## Contentful UI elements are written in lowercase

Contentful UI elements should be written in lowercase consistently across the Contentful products.

Examples of Contentful UI elements include space, entry, and content type.
