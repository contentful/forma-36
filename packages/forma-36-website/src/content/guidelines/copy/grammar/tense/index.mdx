# Tense

## Use present tense

Our UX copy aims to enable users to navigate confidently across the Contentful products. Keep UX copy actionable by using present tense for user interactions.

Present tense should also be used to describe product behavior. Avoid using the future tense to imply that actions should be done at a later time.

Past tense should also be avoided unless necessary to the context.
