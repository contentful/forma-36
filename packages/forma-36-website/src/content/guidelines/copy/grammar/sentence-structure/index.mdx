# Sentence structure

## Focus on the objective of each sentence

To make sentences scannable and easily understandable, start the sentence with the objective when possible.

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        To access this feature, submit a request
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        Submit a request to access this feature
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
/>

## Practice progressive disclosure

Eliminate extra details to keep copy concise and actionable. Reveal details about a feature as the user interacts and requires more information.

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        Once you publish changes to this entry, you can view all previous
        versions
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        There are no previous versions because you haven't made changes to this
        entry yet. As soon as you publish changes, you'll be able to compare
        different versions.
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
/>

## Write concise, scannable sentences

To enable users to navigate quickly, write concise sentences that are easy to understand at a glance. Limit the number of concepts in each sentence.

In most cases, introductory phrases are unnecessary.

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <div>
        <Subheading style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>Set width</Subheading>
        <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          The original aspect ratio is maintained
        </Paragraph>
      </div>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <div>
        <Subheading style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>Set width</Subheading>
        <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          Expected value is a number of pixels between 1 and 9999. Provided
          value will be used as a new width of your image. Its height will be
          automatically computed to maintain the original aspect ratio.
        </Paragraph>
      </div>
    ),
  }}
/>

## Write simple sentences for all audiences

Contentful has users from various technical and non-technical backgrounds. Use simple, direct language that is easy for all users to understand. Avoid industry terms.

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>Up to 256 characters</Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        Requires fewer than 256 characters
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
/>

<ExampleCards
  goodExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        To quickly search with this filter again, save this view
      </Paragraph>
    ),
  }}
  badExample={{
    example: (
      <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
        By saving the current view, you will be able to use it again later
      </Paragraph>
    ),
    info:
      'In this sentence, it is not clear what the value of re-using the view is.',
  }}
/>
