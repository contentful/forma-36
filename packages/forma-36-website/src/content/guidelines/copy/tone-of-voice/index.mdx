# Tone of voice

Tone of voice is not just what you say, but how you say it. It's your choice of words, phrases and grammar. At Contentful, our brand voice never changes, but our tone may change.

## Writing goals and principles

With all product copy, we aim to:

### Empower

We’re empowering experts who in turn empower experts. This means we talk to our customers on their level and give the the information they need to use and love Contentful.

### Be honest

We’re going to strive for honest and transparency in our writing. This means we don’t oversell ourselves, and we keep the customer’s needs in mind at all times.

### Respect

Our customers are busy people. Our writing should tell them what they need to know, and not what we want to say. Writing should respect their time by being focused. We’re always going to be inclusive and considerate.

### Share expertise

We’re going to give our readers the best of our knowledge. Avoid fluff, marketing talk, and patronizing language.

## In order to achieve these goals, we make sure our content is:

### Authentic

Avoid buzzwords, marketing speak, and grandiose self-importance. Speak to people’s level, never patronize, and infuse everything with care. We don’t hide behind jargon. Be genuinely helpful. Not robotic.

### Focused

Take the time to understand the topic you’re writing about. Write clean, concise sentences. Avoid run-on sentences, long paragraphs, and writing that might sound nice, but has no use to the customer.

### Fresh

Contentful isn’t just another Bay Area SaaS. Our writing should introduce new ideas and new perspectives. We’re not just coming up with a new way of saying an old thing.

### Warm

While tech might not be a warm and fuzzy space, our writing should aim to bring the humanness back. Developers are human, and so are high-ranking business people. Writing should be relatable, a little quirky, and if you want to make someone laugh then go ahead.

### Using active voice

Sentences in the active voice have energy and directness. Active voice is one way we can keep Contentful writing fresh and easy to read. Passive voice makes sentences staler than an evening pretzel –– avoid using it as much as you can.

### Respectful

The words we use can alienate people, or they can draw people into a space where they feel welcome and comfortable. Language can push us to imagine certain people in roles (developers, for example), and subsequently discourages others. We want to create a space where everyone feels like they belong.
