## Before contributing

### Check if your idea is already present

Before writing a proposal or any code, we ask you to go around this website or our Github repo and
check if your idea is not yet implemented.
It’s also a good idea to take a look on the current open proposals,
maybe there is something similar to your idea there and you could work together with that proposer.

### Could an existing component be extended to realize your idea?

During your research, did you find a component that almost does what you have in mind?
If yes, consider proposing an update or refactor of this component.

## Contribution Process

### Step 1: Open a Github issue using the Proposal Template

### Step 2: Proposal Review

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

### Step 4: Code & Design Review

### Step 5: Merge the changes to the main branch

## Bugs & Light contributions

Sometimes it’s possible to skip steps 1 and 2 of the contribution process.
This is the case for bugs, if you find something that is broken you can open directly a Pull Request with the fix.
This is also true for what we call "light" contributions. They are visual defects, small visual changes, or adding documentation.
