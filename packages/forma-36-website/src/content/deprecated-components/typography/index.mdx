# Typography

Typography component was removed in version 4. The main reason for this component was to mantain the spacing between typography components. In version 4 we gave this possiblity to each, individual typography component.
Right now istead of wrapping your typography in `Typography` component, you can just set margin value to each insividual typography componennts.

You might have used `Typography` in version 3 like that:

```tsx static=true
<Typography>
  <Heading element="h4" className="className">
    Some text
  </Heading>
</Typography>
```

All you need to do is to use this components directly, without a wrapper:

```tsx static=true
<Heading as="h4" className="className">
  Some text
</Heading>
```
