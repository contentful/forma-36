# Illustration

In version 4, `Illustration` component got removed. In order to replace this component, we recommend using `<img />` tag or existing in Forma 36 icons.

Icons that were used previously by the `Illustration` component were moved to the `@contentful/f36-icons` packages, so you can still use them in your project. Have a look at the full [overview of icons](https://v4.f36.contentful.com/components/icon/)

You can replace existing `Illustration`:

```tsx static=true
<Illustration illustration="Archive" />
```

with:

```tsx static=true
<ArchiveIcon size="large" variant="secondary" />
```
