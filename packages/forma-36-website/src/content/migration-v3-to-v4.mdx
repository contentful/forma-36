# How to migrate your Forma 36 v3 to v4

This step by step guide details how to migrate your Forma 36 components from v3 to v4.

Forma 36 v4 contains multiple fixes requested by the community, such as accessibility improvements, better developer experience, and big performance improvements.

Starting with v4, Forma 36 is split into separate packages, enabling you to download only the specific package for the component you need. üôå

To get the latest updates, you must migrate your project to version 4 of Forma 36. This guide offers you tools and guidance to do it easily by:

- Upgrading Forma 36 from version 3 to version 4
- Dealing with breaking changes

## ‚òùÔ∏è Step 1: Package upgrade

In version 4, our components are separated into packages. The big package is split into smaller ones that you can use separately.
We introduced emotion to our components, so you no longer have to add separate css files to your project. It will work out of the box. [Learn how to install the new Forma 36 packages](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/forma-v4/MIGRATION.md#How-to-migrate-your-packages-to-v4)

## ‚úåÔ∏è Step 2: Breaking changes in components

All the requests and fixes that have been waiting for the next version of the library have been fixed in version 4. The API is now more consistent as some components received major improvements, and all of them were migrated to our [new code style guide](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/forma-v4/docs/code-style-guide.md).

To migrate your project easily, we provided you with a codemod for most of the components. For the ones that do not have a codemod, we created detailed documentation on how to do it.

‚úÖ Tag becomes Badge: We migrated the Tag component to Badge. For more information on how to migrate your Tag to Badge, see [the detailed documentation](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/blob/forma-v4/MIGRATION.md#how-to-migrate-your-tag-to-badge).
