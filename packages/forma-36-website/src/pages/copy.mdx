<DisplayText>Copy Guidelines</DisplayText>

This style guide was created to empower our product team at Contentful to write consistent, simple and empowering copy throughout our app. We're happy to share it with other teams to adapt and learn from.

While some of the principles of this style guide are useful for branding and documentation teams, currently this style guide is focusing on UX copy.

What’s the difference? Well, take this example: - On the Contentful marketing website, we want potential customers to understand the value of Contentful and start a conversation with us if they are interested in trying Contentful for their organizaiton. The copy may be less direct and more value-oriented.

In the Contentful product, we want to make sure users understand exactly what they can expect to happen if they click on a button or interact with the application. The copy is direct, concise, and always in present tense—it’s written to help users navigate easily and accomplish their tasks.

- In the documentation, we want to educate users about Contentful concepts. The documentation is thorough, consise, and may contain diagrams and examples to help illustrate the concepts further.

- This is our first iteration of the UX Copywriting Style Guide, and we will continue to update it as we gather feedback, implement the copy, and learn from our users via UX research.

Feedback and questions are welcome!
