The ValidationMessage component provides a consisdent styled paragraph for messages in case of validation errors.

## Best practices

- Only use this component in the context of a form and as corresponding guidance to an input field which has validations.

## Copy considerations

Todo: Provide copy considerations

## Example

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <FormLabel htmlFor="name" required>
    Full Name
  </FormLabel>
  <TextInput
    name="name"
    value="Lorem Ipsum"
    className="f36-margin-bottom--xs"
  />
  <ValidationMessage>Name is a required field</ValidationMessage>
</React.Fragment>
```
