The ValidationMessage component provides a consisdent styled paragraph for messages in case of validation errors.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <FormLabel htmlFor="name" required>
    Full name
  </FormLabel>
  <TextInput
    name="name"
    value="Claus Mitchell"
    className="f36-margin-bottom--xs"
  />
  <ValidationMessage>Name is a required field</ValidationMessage>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Best practices

- Only use this component in the context of a form and as corresponding guidance to an input field which has validations.

## Copy considerations

- Avoid negative words and tone
- Give direction on how to fix the error
- Use direct, succinct copy. Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- Do not use punctuation
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)
