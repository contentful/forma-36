Forma 36 includes a number of typography components, including a wrapper to automatically add spacing to typography elements.

Typography components are not tied to specific semantic elements - it's possible to render any typography component as a `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` or `p` element.

## Heading

```jsx
<Heading>Heading</Heading>
```

## Subheading

```jsx
<Subheading>Subheading</Subheading>
```

## SectionHeading

```jsx
<SectionHeading>SectionHeading</SectionHeading>
```

## Paragraph

```jsx
<Paragraph>Paragraph</Paragraph>
```

## DisplayText

DisplayText is used to display text in special scenarios - example usages of DisplayText include empty states, promotional/featured items, etc.

DisplayText should **not** be used as a replacement for headings/page titles (use the Heading component instead).

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <DisplayText size="large">DisplayText (large)</DisplayText>
  <DisplayText>DisplayText</DisplayText>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Typography wrapper

The `<Typography>` component should be used to wrap a group of typography components (`<Heading>`, `<Paragraph>`, etc) for cases where you wish to display these components with default margins.

We follow the principle that a component should only be responsible for its own internal spacing - never its external spacing. This means that we're flexible in where our components can be used without having to override margins.

```jsx
<Typography>
  <Heading>My heading</Heading>
  <Paragraph>My paragraph</Paragraph>
</Typography>
```
