Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user clicks them. They contain a text label to describe the action, and an icon if appropriate.

## Button variations <a name="variations" />

The `Button` component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is a guide to when to use certain variations.

### Button with icon (`icon`) <a name="button-with-icon" />

## Writing guidelines <a name="writing-guidelines" />

- To make `Button` action-oriented, use a verb. EX: "Add field", not "New field"
- Consider what happens after a user clicks on the button and communicate that clearly in the copy. For example, “Get a UI Extension” vs “Explore all UI Extensions”
- Use clear and succinct copy
