`HelpText` is a styled copy block with guidance, placed in the context of form components.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <FormLabel htmlFor="name">
    Full name
  </FormLabel>
  <TextInput
    name="name"
    value="Claus Mitchell"
    className="f36-margin-bottom--xs"
  />
  <HelpText>Enter your first and last name</HelpText>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Best practices <a name="best-practices" />

- Only use this component in the context of a form, and as corresponding guidance to an input field

## Writing guidelines <a name="writing-guidelines" />

- Use direct, succinct copy that helps the user to successfully complete the form
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- Do not use punctuation
- Use sentence style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized)
