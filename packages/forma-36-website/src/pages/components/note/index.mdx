Notes draw the users attention to a circumstance relevant to an action they're performing or a screen they're accessing.

## Best practices

- Consider the context of where the note is displayed when selecting the type of note to use.
- Don't confuse notes with notifications, which appear as feedback after a user has performed an action.

## Copy considerations

- Use clear and succinct copy
- Ensure note is scannable. Focus on the objective and limit the number of concepts in each sentence.
- Use progressive disclosure. Eliminate extra details that can be revealed as the user interacts and requires more information.
- Use active voice, present tense, and consider tone of voice depending on the circumstance.

## Note variations

The Note component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is a guide to when to use certain variations.

### Note types (`noteType`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note noteType="positive">Positive</Note>
  <Note noteType="warning">Warning</Note>
  <Note noteType="negative">Negative</Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

| **Negative** | For negative/highly critical messages - for informing of errors                                                         |
| **Warning**  | Used for a warning messages                                                                                             |
