Notes draw the users attention to a circumstance relevant to an action they're performing or a screen they're accessing.

## Best practices

- Use clear and concise messaging to users.
- Don't confuse Notes with notifications, which appear as feedback after a user has performed an action.
- Make sure you use the correct Note type to suit the context the Note is displayed in.

## Note variations

The Note component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is a guide to when to use certain variations.

### Note types (`noteType`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note noteType="positive">Positive</Note>
  <Note noteType="warning">Warning</Note>
  <Note noteType="negative">Negative</Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

| **Negative** | For negative/highly critical messages - for informing of errors                                                         |
| **Warning**  | Used for a warning messages                                                                                             |
