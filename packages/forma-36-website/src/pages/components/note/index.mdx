Notes provide context and information about a situation or action.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>
    Information that is relevant to the context the user is currently in.
  </Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Best practices

- Use an adequate note type to communicate the right kind of information
- Place the note visually closer to the action or real estate it relates to
- Unlike notifications, notes don't show up as feedback only after a user has performed an action

## Copy considerations

- Use clear and succinct copy
- Ensure the copy is easily scannable. Focus on the objective and limit the number of concepts in each sentence
- Use progressive disclosure. Eliminate details that can be revealed as the user interacts and requires more information
- Use active voice, present tense, and consider tone of voice depending on the circumstance
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"

## Variations

The Note component can be configured in a number of different ways. Learn when to use certain variations with this guide.

### Note types (`noteType`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note noteType="positive">Positive</Note>
  <Note noteType="warning">Warning</Note>
  <Note noteType="negative">Negative</Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

| Note Type    | Notes                                                                                 |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary**  | Used to show information that has neither positive, negative, or warning connotations |
| **Positive** | Used to display messages with a successful outcome                                    |
| **Negative** | Used for critical information, such as errors or failure                              |
| **Warning**  | Used for warning messages, useful to know before an action is taken                   |

### Note with title (`title`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note title="Primary title">Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note title="Positive title" noteType="positive">
    Positive
  </Note>
