# Copy Guidelines

## Welcome to the Contentful UX copy style guide

The purpose of this guide is to empower the product team at Contentful to write consistent and intentional copy across our web app. We're happy to share it with other teams to adapt and learn from.
Our UX copy aims to be simple, clear, approachable, and supportive to enable all of our users to navigate confidently through their workflows with Contentful.

This is our first iteration of the UX copy style guide. We will continue to update it as we gather feedback, apply the style guide throughout our product, and learn from our users.

Feedback and questions are welcome!
