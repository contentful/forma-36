# Capitalization

## Use sentence style caps

Sentence style caps, in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized, should be used across the web app.
This makes sentences a bit more scannable and our UX copy more approachable.
Example uses:

- labels
- headings
- titles
- buttons
- menu items

- entry
- content type
