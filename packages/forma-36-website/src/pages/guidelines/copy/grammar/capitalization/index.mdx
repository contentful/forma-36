# Capitalization

## Use sentence style caps

Sentence style caps, in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized, should be used across all Contentful products.

This makes sentences a bit more scannable and our UX copy more approachable.

Places where you should use sentence style caps include labels, headings, titles, buttons, and menu items.

![Example of correct usage of sentence style caps - use 'View your website live' rather than 'View Your Website Live'](/sentence-style-caps.jpg)
