# Word choice

## Use contractions when possible

To make a sentence more scannable and easier to understand, use contradictions when possible. Note that in some cases the words can have more emphasis when they are not contracted (**Do not** has greater emphasis than **Don’t**).

## Address users based on context (Your, My, We)

Determine the appropriate pronoun based on the context. Focus on the user and the actions the user is taking whenever possible. Avoid mixing prounouns ("my" and "your”) in the same section— It can cause confusion to see both forms of addressing the user in the same context.

**Second person (“you” or “your”)**
Use this conversational style for most situations that require a pronoun (when the app is speaking directly to the user).

**First person (“I” or “my”)**
This may be used to emphasize the user's ownership of content or actions.

**The pronouns “we” and “our”**
Overall, Focus on the user rather than what you or your app is doing for the user. “We” should only be used in situations where the only alternative is for the app to take the action on behalf of the user.

## Avoid abbreviations

Opt to spell out each word in full rather than using an abbreviation.

## Use terms consistently

Use verbs in a consistent manner across the description of an action/ feature.
Example: Remove and Delete.
