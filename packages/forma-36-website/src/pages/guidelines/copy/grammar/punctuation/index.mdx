# Punctuation

## Use periods consistently

To help readers scan UX copy at a glance, only use periods when necessary.

Periods should not be used on:

- labels
- tool-tips
- bulleted lists

Periods should be used on:

- multiple sentences
- any sentence followed by a link
- modal body text

## Avoid exclamation marks

Exclamation marks may come across as shouting and do not fit the brand tone established for the web app. There are some exceptions when it is appropriate to use exclamation marks, such as a greeting or congratulatory message.

## Skip colons after labels

Colons work well to separate text in body copy, but do not need to be used in stand-alone copy, such as labels.
