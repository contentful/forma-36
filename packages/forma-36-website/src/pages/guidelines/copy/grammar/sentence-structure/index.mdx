# Sentence structure

## Begin with the objective

If a sentence describes both an objective and the action needed to achieve that objective, start the sentence with the objective.

## Reveal detail as necessary

Describing every detail in the first interaction is not necessary. Reveal detail about a feature as the user explores and requires more information.
