# Copy Guidelines

## Welcome to the Contentful UX copy style guide

This style guide was created to empower our product team at Contentful to write consistent, simple and empowering copy throughout our app. We're happy to share it with other teams to adapt and learn from.

At Contentful, we like to think of our team as a group of empowering experts. We want to motivate developers, editors, authors, admins, and managers to confidently navigate through their workflows with Contentful. Our UX copy aims to be simple, clear, approachable, and supportiveâ€” written by real people from teams in Berlin and San Francisco.

This is our first iteration of the UX copy style guide, and we will continue to update it as we gather feedback, apply the style guide throughout our product, and learn from our users.

Feedback and questions are welcome!
