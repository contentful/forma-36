# General

This section contains general information about the component library we use at Contentful. The component library is the single source of truth we reference when designing or adding UI.

The component library is split into the following sections:

## Documentation

A place for general documentation about the component library.

## Tokens

Design tokens are the granular values we use when designing and implementing UI. Tokens include things such as font-sizes and colours.

Design tokens can now be found on the [Forma 36 documentation website](../tokens/color-system)

## Components

React components available for immediate use.

### Library Usage

Install the package to your project

```bash
yarn add @contentful/f36-components
```

Or for NPM

```bash
npm i @contentful/f36-components
```

##### Import desired component into your project

```jsx
import { Input } from '@contentful/f36-components';
```
