{"**F36 Typography** `v4.68.0`":["- Update styling of SectionHeading component\n"],"**F36 Entity List** `v4.68.1`":["- fix(<entitylistitem>): differentiate click events for entire entity card, and actions menu\n- It was previously impossible to differentiate when a user was clicking the menu trigger/menu\n- and when they were clicking anywhere else in the entity card, because events that occur in\n- the trigger/menu were also bubbling up the to the onclick handler for the entire card.\n- This PR also resolves a react validateDOM() warning, because when rendering an action menu,\n- we were rendering a button within a button.\n- The solution was to create a fragment container with 2 children, the first containing the\n- actual entity card elements like thumbnail, title, description etc. and the second\n- containing the optional actions menu. That way, click events from either component do not\n- clash with eachother.\n"]}
