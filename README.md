## Packages

Forma 36 is a monorepo maintained using Lerna. Get started with Lerna by following this link: https://github.com/lerna/lerna

The monorepo is currently structured into the following packages:

- [`forma-36-website`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-website)
  - This package includes the design system documentation which offers guidelines, best practices and examples.
    See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-website/README.md)
- [`forma-36-react-components`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-react-components)
  - A React component library built with Storybook. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-react-components/README.md)
- [`forma-36-fcss`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-fcss)
  - CSS utility classes for spacing, typography, colors and transitions. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-fcss/README.md)
- [`forma-36-tokens`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-tokens)
  - Forma 36 design tokens. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-tokens/README.md)

### Adding packages

To add another package create a new directory in the packages folder. Make sure that the package name is prefixed with forma-36 (e.g. forma-36-css-utilities). Since we are using Lerna all package scripts are available from the root by running lerna run {script_name}

## Font Usage

Forma 36 was designed to use ‘Avenir Next’ as primary font family. If a package is used in the context of app.contentful.com (e.g UI extensions) this font will be provided. We encourage licensing ‘Avenir Next’ when a package is used outside of Contentful related use cases.

## Commiting & Releasing

**_About alpha versions_**: Forma 36 is currently in alpha. Please use the keyword `alpha` in the version number when using `lerna publish`.

```
? Select a new version for @contentful/forma-36-react-components (currently 1.0.2-alpha.0)
  Patch (1.0.2)
  Minor (1.1.0)
  Major (2.0.0)
❯ Prepatch (1.0.3-alpha.0)
  Preminor (1.1.0-alpha.0)
  Premajor (2.0.0-alpha.0)
  Custom Prerelease
  Custom Version
```

**_About non alpha releases_**: Use `yarn commit`. This uses the [Commitzen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) CLI to create a semantic commit message based on your changes. CI will publish to NPM using `yarn semantic-release`.

_NOTE: It is important that every new package includes semantic-release and semantic-release-monorepo in the dev-dependency list so that semantic release will work from the root of the monorepo._
