## Packages

Forma 36 is a monorepo maintained using Lerna. Get started with Lerna by following this link: https://github.com/lerna/lerna

The monorepo is currently structured into the following packages:

- [`forma-36-website`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-website)
  - This package includes the design system documentation which offers guidelines, best practices and examples.
    See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-website/README.md)
- [`forma-36-react-components`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-react-components)
  - A React component library built with Storybook. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-react-components/README.md)
- [`forma-36-fcss`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-fcss)
  - CSS utility classes for spacing, typography, colors and transitions. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-fcss/README.md)
- [`forma-36-tokens`](https://github.com/contentful/forma-36/tree/master/packages/forma-36-tokens)
  - Forma 36 design tokens. See the README [here](./packages/forma-36-tokens/README.md)

### Adding packages

To add another package create a new directory in the packages folder. Make sure that the package name is prefixed with forma-36 (e.g. forma-36-css-utilities). Since we are using Lerna all package scripts are available from the root by running lerna run {script_name}

## Commits & releases

Use `yarn commit`. This uses the [Commitzen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) CLI to create a conventional commit message based on your changes. CI is setup to release all new commits on the master branch.

## Testing changes locally

You can test changes to a package of this monorepo in your own project locally by taking the following steps:

1. Run `yarn build` in the desired package's directory to ensure your latest changes have been built
2. Run `yarn link` in the desired package's directory
3. Change to your local project's directory and run `yarn link NAME_OF_PACKAGE` to link to the local version of the package (e.g. `yarn link @contentful/forma-36-react-components`)
